# Chapter 27: Against the Grain, On Purpose

Walking through the fair with Audrey and Tommy felt different than it had that morning.

This morning I'd been nervous, uncertain, hoping for validation I'd told myself I didn't need. Now—with the blue ribbon tucked in my pocket, my father's pride still warm in my chest, Audrey's hand in mine—I felt settled. Grounded.

Like I finally knew who I was and where I was going.

We passed my booth in the agriculture tent. The display boards still stood there, professional and solid. A few late visitors were reading through the materials, taking information sheets. The work I'd done, continuing to matter even after the competition ended.

"Look at that," Tommy said, pointing. "People are actually reading your stuff."

"Seems that way."

"How does it feel? Being taken seriously?"

I thought about it. "Good. But also—it would have mattered anyway. Even if nobody took it seriously, I'd know I did good work. That's the foundation."

Tommy mock-gasped. "Who are you and what have you done with Wade Turner?"

"Shut up."

"No, seriously. Six weeks ago you'd have said you didn't care what anyone thought while clearly caring desperately what everyone thought. Now you actually don't need the validation."

"I like the validation," I corrected. "But it's not the foundation. That's different."

"Maturity looks weird on you," Tommy said, but he was grinning.

We kept walking, weaving through the evening crowds. The fair was hitting its peak time—families with kids getting one last ride before heading home, teenagers roaming in packs, older couples strolling hand in hand. The community gathered together in that particular way small towns did, where everyone knew everyone and the fair was less an event than a ritual.

I'd spent so many years hating this place. Feeling trapped by its smallness, suffocated by everyone knowing my business, desperate to escape to anywhere else.

But walking through it now, I saw it differently.

This was home. Flawed, claustrophobic at times, full of judgment and gossip. But also full of people who showed up for each other, who maintained traditions that mattered, who cared enough to pay attention even when that attention felt intrusive.

I didn't have to escape it. I just had to figure out how to be myself within it.

Going against the grain on purpose instead of by default.

"Wade Turner!"

I turned to find Mrs. Henderson—one of the church ladies who'd been gossiping about me just last Sunday—bearing down on us with a determined expression.

I braced myself.

"I wanted to congratulate you on your presentation," she said, surprising me. "Very impressive. My husband farms, you know, and he was very taken with your crop rotation proposal. Says it's the kind of thinking the county needs."

"Oh. Thank you, ma'am."

"And I wanted to apologize." She lowered her voice slightly. "I may have said some unkind things about you recently. About whether you were actually changing or just putting on a show. I was wrong to judge so quickly. You've proven yourself quite definitively."

The apology was stiff, formal, but genuine.

"I appreciate that," I said.

"Well. Anyway. Congratulations again." She nodded to Audrey. "And you must be the young lady from Atlanta. Welcome to Oakdale, dear."

After she left, Tommy whistled low. "Did Mrs. Henderson just apologize to you?"

"Apparently."

"The apocalypse is nigh."

But it felt significant. The town had been watching, waiting for me to fail or prove them right about who I was. And I'd done neither. I'd just—shown them someone different. Someone they maybe hadn't expected but could respect.

We ran into more people as the evening went on. Farmers who'd attended my presentation, wanting to discuss implementation details. Teachers from school, surprised and pleased by my success. Even Ray Coleman, though he just glowered from across the midway and didn't approach.

I nodded to him anyway. Not friendly, but not hostile. Just acknowledging his presence without needing to engage or prove anything.

Ray's opinion didn't matter anymore. That was the real difference. Not that I'd proved him wrong, but that I didn't need to.

"You know what's wild?" Tommy said as we watched the Ferris wheel turn against the darkening sky.

"What?"

"This morning you were the bad boy rebel fighting against everything. Tonight you're the responsible farmer's son with the innovative agriculture project. But you're still you. You didn't actually change that much—you just figured out what you were fighting for."

He was right. I was still stubborn, still quick to defend what mattered to me, still going against the grain of how things had always been done.

But now it was purposeful. Directed. In service of building something instead of tearing things down.

"That's the difference between reactive and intentional," Audrey said. "Same energy, different direction."

"Exactly." I looked out at the fair, at the community I'd grown up in and was choosing to stay in. "I'm still going against the grain. Most people in Oakdale don't think the way I think about farming. They're happy doing things the way they've always been done. But I'm doing it purposefully now, not just rebelling for the sake of rebelling."

"Your dad seemed to get that," Tommy said. "When he was watching your presentation. He looked—I don't know. Proud, but also like he was seeing you for the first time."

"Maybe he was. Maybe I was seeing him for the first time too."

We ended up back at the livestock barn, where the evening cattle judging was wrapping up. My father was there with the other committee members, discussing scores and placements. When he saw me, he caught my eye and nodded—acknowledgment that we'd see each other at home, that the conversation from earlier still stood.

My brother found me a few minutes later.

"Dad's been talking you up to everyone," he said, amused. "Can't shut up about your project. Pretty sure half the county's heard about the sustainable farming proposal by now."

"Really?"

"Really. It's weird. Good weird. But weird." He clapped me on the shoulder. "Welcome to being the favorite son for once."

"I don't need to be the favorite."

"I know. That's why you probably will be." He grinned. "Just kidding. But seriously—he's proud. More than I've ever seen him. You did good, little brother."

After he left, Audrey slipped her arm around my waist.

"How does it feel?" she asked. "Having what you wanted for so long?"

I thought about it. My father's pride, the town's respect, recognition for work I believed in. Six months ago, I'd have said I didn't care about any of it. Three months ago, I'd have been desperate for it.

Now?

"It feels good," I said honestly. "But it's not everything. It's just—confirmation that I'm on the right path. The path matters more than the confirmation."

"Look at you, all self-actualized."

"Don't make fun."

"I'm not. I'm proud of you too." She leaned her head on my shoulder. "You've become the person you were trying to be. That's not nothing."

We stood there watching the livestock judging wind down, the families congratulating their kids, the cattle being led back to their pens. The familiar rhythms of a county fair in late summer, playing out like they had for generations.

I used to see tradition as a trap. But now I understood it differently. Tradition was the foundation you built on, not the ceiling that kept you down. You could honor where you came from while still choosing where you were going.

That was the balance I'd been looking for. The way to be both my father's son and my own man. To belong to this place while still charting my own course.

Against the grain, but on purpose. With intention. With direction.

That made all the difference.

Tommy rejoined us, announcing that he'd finally won the giant stuffed bear at the ring toss and was feeling invincible.

"We should get food," he declared. "Victory demands funnel cake."

"You won a stuffed animal. That's not exactly a heroic achievement."

"Let me have this moment, Wade."

We walked toward the food stalls together—Audrey laughing at Tommy's ridiculous bear, Tommy declaring he was going to name it something dignified like Archibald, me just taking it all in. The fair, the friends, the future spreading out ahead of me like the Georgia fields I'd grown up in.

This was my life. My choice. My path.

Not running away. Not fighting against. Just moving forward with purpose and intention and the courage to keep choosing even when it was hard.

I thought about Monday morning. Sitting down with my father to plan implementation timelines. Starting the real work of transforming the Turner farm. Beginning the partnership we'd both needed but hadn't known how to build.

I thought about senior year starting next week. College applications to work on. The agricultural science programs the extension agent had mentioned. A future I could actually envision now, specific and concrete and mine.

I thought about Audrey eventually leaving for MIT or Carnegie Mellon, and the work it would take to maintain what we had across distance. The choice to keep choosing each other even when it got difficult.

All of it felt possible. Manageable. Like challenges worth facing instead of problems to escape.

The fair would end tomorrow. Monday would bring normal life back—farm work and school and the everyday grind of choosing forward. But standing here tonight, surrounded by the people and place I'd chosen to be part of, I felt ready for it.

Ready for all of it.

Not because everything would be easy or perfect. But because I finally knew what I was fighting for.

Myself. My family. My land. My future.

And that was everything.
