# Chapter 21: What He's Really Fighting

I lasted until dark.

Sat in that barn until I couldn't stand being alone with my thoughts anymore. Then I got in my truck and drove.

The drag strip was exactly where it had always been. I could hear it before I saw it—engines revving, guys shouting, tires on packed dirt. Friday night, same as ever.

I pulled in and parked at the edge of the lot, engine idling.

Through my windshield, I could see it all. Billy Dawson with his Chevy, betting money he didn't have. A couple guys from the next county looking for races. Someone passing around a bottle. The makeshift starting line, the quarter-mile strip, the finish nobody officially recognized but everyone knew.

Familiar. Comfortable. Easy.

I turned off the engine.

The silence in my truck was louder than the chaos outside. I sat there, hands on the steering wheel, just watching.

Guys were waving at me—come on, Turner, get out here, we need another race. Someone shouted that they'd heard about my "school project" and were taking bets on how long before I gave up on it. Laughter carried across the lot.

I should have gotten out. Should have raced until the adrenaline drowned out the disappointment. Should have proved I didn't care.

But I just sat there.

And as I watched them—the drinking, the posturing, the reckless racing—it all looked empty. Hollow. Like something that used to mean something but didn't anymore.

Audrey had been right.

I'd been using this place as armor. As escape. As proof that I didn't care about the things that actually hurt when I didn't have them. Racing wasn't about loving speed or even competition. It was about running. About choosing the dramatic gesture—the rebellion, the recklessness, the middle finger to everyone who expected better—instead of sitting with the uncomfortable truth.

The truth that I did care. That I wanted my father to see me. That I wanted to matter.

That I wanted respect, and approval, and to belong—and pretending I didn't want those things didn't make them hurt less when I didn't get them.

I looked at the drag strip, really looked at it, and realized something that felt like a key turning in a lock.

I didn't want to be here.

Not tonight. Maybe not ever again. Not like this—not running from something, hiding from something, using speed and noise to drown out the parts of myself I didn't know how to face.

What I wanted—what I'd been wanting this whole time without being able to name it—was my father's respect. On my own terms. Not by becoming who he wanted me to be, but by showing him who I actually was.

That's what I was fighting for.

Not against his expectations. Not against the farm or the town or the life everyone said I should want. For something. For recognition. For partnership. For the chance to build something meaningful with my own hands and have it matter to the people who mattered to me.

Fighting for, not against.

The distinction felt enormous.

I started my truck.

Billy was halfway across the lot, coming to get me, when I backed out. I saw his confused expression in my rearview mirror as I turned around and headed for the exit.

---

Tommy's headlights appeared in my mirror about two miles down the road. He flashed his high beams—the signal to pull over. I found a turnoff near Miller's pond and waited.

He parked next to me, got out, leaned against my truck.

"You okay?"

"Yeah."

"You didn't race."

"No."

Through the trees, the pond reflected moonlight like scattered silver.

"My father saw my proposal," I said. "Told me it was theoretical nonsense. Said I'm still just avoiding real work."

Tommy winced. "Man. I'm sorry."

"Yeah."

"So you went to the strip to blow off steam."

"I went to the strip because that's what I always do," I corrected. "Father disappoints me, I disappoint him right back by doing exactly what he expects. Prove I don't care. Prove nothing he says matters."

"But you didn't race."

"No." I looked at the pond, the trees, anywhere but at Tommy. "Because I realized sitting there that I was fighting the wrong battle."

"What do you mean?"

The words were hard to find, but important. Worth finding.

"I've spent five years fighting against my father. Against his expectations, his disappointment, his plans for my life. Every time he pushed me toward farming, I pushed back harder. Every time he said I was wrong, I proved him right just to show I didn't care." I finally looked at Tommy. "But I was fighting the wrong thing."

"What should you have been fighting?"

"Not fighting. Fighting for." The distinction settled in my chest like something solid. "I don't want to fight against my father anymore. I want to fight for his respect. For him to see me as I actually am, not as who he's disappointed I'm not. I want partnership, not war."

Tommy was quiet for a minute, processing.

"That's what the proposal was about," he said finally. "Not proving him wrong. Proving yourself right."

"Yeah. Exactly." The relief of being understood was intense. "I've been so busy proving I'm not who he wants me to be, I never bothered showing him who I actually am. I just kept giving him proof that I'm the screwup he already thinks I am."

"To be fair, he's not making it easy."

"No. But running to the drag strip every time he disappoints me isn't making it easier either."

A breeze picked up, rustling through the pines. The night was warm, humid, full of summer sounds. In a few weeks, school would start properly. Fall would come. The seasons would turn whether I was ready or not.

"So what now?" Tommy asked. "If he's not going to listen, if he's just going to dismiss everything you do—what's the point of trying?"

The question I'd been asking myself in the barn.

"I'm going to finish the project," I said. "Enter it in the fair. Whether my father approves or not."

"Why? I mean, if it's not going to change anything with him—"

"Because it's not about him." The truth of it surprised me even as I said it. "Or it is, but not only. It's about me. About doing work I believe in because I believe in it. About choosing what I'm fighting for instead of just reacting to what everyone else wants."

Tommy studied me in the dim light. "You're really doing this."

"Yeah."

"For yourself."

"For myself."

"Not for Audrey. Not to prove Ray wrong. Not even to get your father's approval."

"If I get his approval, that'd be great. But I can't make that the foundation." I remembered Audrey's words. "External validation can't be the foundation. I have to believe in myself first."

"And do you? Believe in yourself?"

I thought about the proposal in the barn. Thirty pages of solid work. Research and planning and genuine effort toward something I actually wanted. My father had dismissed it, but that didn't make it valueless. It didn't make me valueless.

"I'm learning to," I said.

Tommy pushed off from my truck, stretched. "You know people are going to talk, right? About you leaving the strip without racing. About you still entering the fair even though your father thinks it's a waste of time. Ray's going to have a field day."

"Let him."

"That's very mature of you."

"I'm working on it."

Tommy laughed—genuine, not mocking. "You really are. It's weird, man. Good weird. But weird."

"Yeah, well. Growing up is weird."

"Is that what this is?"

I considered. "I think so. Or the start of it anyway."

We stood there in comfortable silence for a while, listening to the crickets and the breeze and the quiet sounds of a Georgia night. This—standing here with my best friend, being honest about what I wanted and what scared me—this felt real in a way the drag strip hadn't.

Real was harder. Real was uncomfortable. But real was also solid. Something you could build on.

"You want to get food?" Tommy asked. "Harper's is probably still open."

"Actually, I think I'm going to head home. Got work to do."

"The proposal?"

"Yeah. And—" I hesitated, then committed. "I'm going to talk to my father again. Really talk. Not just present something and wait for approval, but actually have a conversation. Like adults."

"Think he'll listen?"

"Probably not. At least not the first time. But Audrey said something about how trying once isn't the same as committing to the difficult work of changing a relationship. That takes multiple conversations. Patience. Sitting with the discomfort instead of running from it."

"You're quoting Audrey now?"

"She's smart."

"I know. I like her." Tommy headed for his truck, then turned back. "For what it's worth, I think you're doing the right thing. And I think your dad will come around eventually. He just needs time to see you're serious."

"Thanks."

"And Wade?" Tommy paused. "I'm proud of you, man. For real."

The words hit differently than I expected. Not like my father's approval would hit—that mix of validation and relief and finally being seen. But good in its own way. My best friend, who'd known me through all the worst parts, saying he was proud.

"Thanks," I said again, quieter.

After Tommy drove off, I sat in my truck for a few more minutes, looking at the pond. My reflection looked back from the dark water—distorted, uncertain, but there.

I thought about all the nights I'd come to the strip, racing to outrun myself. All the fights I'd picked to prove I didn't care about being hurt. All the ways I'd spent five years running from the one thing I actually wanted: to matter. To belong. To be seen.

Well, no more running.

I was going to fight for what I wanted. Even if it was hard. Even if my father didn't understand at first. Even if the town doubted me and Ray mocked me and I failed more times than I succeeded.

I was going to fight for myself.

For the first time, that felt like enough.

I drove home slowly, windows down, radio off. Just the sound of the engine and the night and my own steady breathing.

The barn light was still on—I'd left it on when I fled earlier. The proposal still sat on the workbench where my father had left it.

Tomorrow, I'd pick it up again. Keep working. Keep trying.

Tonight, I'd sleep knowing I'd made a choice. A real choice.

To stop fighting against and start fighting for.

That was real rebellion. That was real courage.

And it was mine.
