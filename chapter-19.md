# Chapter 19: Racing or Running

We kept walking through the cotton fields, the sun climbing higher. My headache had faded, but my thoughts were sharper now. Clearer.

"Can I ask you something else?" Audrey said.

"Yeah."

"When you race—why do you do it? Because you love it? Or because it's easier than having hard conversations?"

I opened my mouth to defend myself, but the words died.

"And when you fight," she continued, gentle but relentless. "Is it because you're defending something that matters? Or because fighting is familiar and vulnerability isn't?"

"That's not fair."

"Isn't it?"

We'd reached the edge of the field, where the land dropped away slightly and you could see the whole valley spread out below. The overlook where I'd brought her that first time. The place I came when I wanted to escape.

Escape.

"You're saying I'm running away," I said.

"I'm asking if you are." Audrey sat down on the grass at the field's edge, and after a moment I joined her. "Because it seems like every time things get difficult—every time you're faced with an uncomfortable conversation or a vulnerable moment—you choose the dramatic gesture instead."

"That's not—" But I stopped. Was it?

"Your father dismisses your ideas," Audrey said. "Do you have an adult conversation about it? Or do you go race to prove you don't care what he thinks?"

I didn't answer.

"Ray provokes you. Do you walk away because his opinion doesn't matter? Or do you punch him because it's familiar?"

"He said—"

"I know. But were you defending me, or falling back on what's familiar?"

The truth sat between us like a stone. I picked up a clod of dirt, crumbled it in my hands. The Georgia soil was red and rich, same as it had been for generations. Same as it would be long after I was gone.

"It's easier," I admitted finally. "Racing. Fighting. Getting angry and doing something instead of just—" I struggled for words. "Instead of sitting with the uncomfortable feeling."

"What uncomfortable feeling?"

I looked out at the valley. "That I care. That I want my father's respect and it kills me that I don't have it. That I want to belong in Oakdale instead of always being the screwup. That I—" I stopped.

"That you what?"

The words were hard to say. Harder than throwing a punch ever was.

"That I care what happens to me. To us. To all of it." I turned to look at her. "Fighting is easier than admitting that. Racing is easier than saying 'I care and it hurts that you don't see me.' It's easier than being honest."

Audrey nodded slowly. "And when things hurt, you run."

"I race," I corrected automatically, then heard what I'd said. "I—yeah. I run."

"Not literally. But emotionally? You've been running for years, Wade."

She wasn't being cruel. That was somehow worse—she was just stating a fact we both knew was true.

"After your mother died, your father retreated into work. Instead of trying to bridge the gap, you ran. You rebelled. You built walls and called it independence."

"It was easier than watching him pull away."

"I know. But you're still running. Still choosing the dramatic gesture instead of the difficult conversation."

She was right. Every hard moment with my father, I'd walked away instead of communicating. Every time someone doubted me, I'd proved them right. Every time I felt vulnerable, I'd armored up with recklessness.

"I don't know how to do the other thing," I said. "The sitting with it. The hard conversation."

"Yes you do. You're doing it right now."

I looked at her, surprised.

"This is uncomfortable," Audrey said. "Me asking you hard questions, you having to examine your own patterns. But you're still here. You're still talking to me. You haven't walked away or gotten angry or gone racing to avoid it."

She was right. I was uncomfortable as hell, but I was choosing to stay in it.

"That's growth," she said. "That's the difference between reaction and choice."

Reaction versus choice. The distinction felt important, like a key turning in a lock.

"I've been reacting," I said slowly. "For years. My father expects me to farm, so I react by refusing. The town judges me, so I react by proving them right. Ray provokes me, so I react by fighting. But none of that is—it's not choosing. It's just responding to what everyone else does."

"Exactly." Audrey pulled her knees up to her chest. "And when you're only reacting, you're still letting other people control you. You think you're being independent, but you're just doing the opposite of what they want instead of figuring out what you want."

The truth of it settled in my bones. I'd thought rebellion was freedom. But if I was only rebelling because that's what they expected, was I any freer than if I'd just done what they wanted?

"So what do I do?" I asked. "How do I stop reacting and start choosing?"

"You figure out what you actually want. Specifically. Not 'I don't want to be stuck on the farm'—that's still reactive. But 'I want to modernize the farm using sustainable practices' or 'I want to study agricultural science' or whatever it is. Something you're moving toward, not away from."

"I want to prove you can honor tradition while still innovating," I said. "I want to show my father that change doesn't mean disrespect. I want to make the farm work in a way that's mine but still part of the Turner legacy."

"Okay. That's specific. That's something."

"But my father doesn't listen when I try to talk to him about it."

"Does he not listen? Or do you give up after one dismissal and go race instead?"

The question stung.

"Trying once isn't the same as committing to the difficult work of changing a relationship. That takes time. Multiple conversations, most of which won't go well. It takes sitting with the discomfort instead of running from it."

"That sounds exhausting."

"It is. But so is racing. So is fighting. You're spending the energy either way—you just have to decide if you're spending it running away or building something."

She was right. I put just as much effort into rebellion as I would into actually trying.

"What would you do?" I asked. "If you were me?"

Audrey was quiet for a long moment, looking out at the valley.

"I'd figure out exactly what I wanted," she said finally. "Then I'd pursue it whether people believed in me or not. Whether my father approved or not. Because external validation can't be your foundation. If you're only trying because you want someone else's approval, you'll crumble the first time you don't get it."

Like last night.

"You have to believe in yourself first," Audrey said. "Believe that what you want matters, that you're worth the effort. Nobody else can give you that. Not your father. Not the town. Not even me."

"What if I don't know how to believe in myself?"

"Then you practice. You make a choice—a real choice, not a reaction—and you follow through even when it's hard. Then you make another choice. And another. Eventually, you'll have enough evidence that you can trust yourself."

We sat in silence for a while. A hawk circled overhead, riding the thermals. The cotton rustled behind us. The farm spread out below, solid and real and waiting.

I thought about the county fair. Four weeks away, according to the flyer I'd seen in town. Agricultural exhibits, livestock shows, innovation competitions.

"The fair has an agriculture category," I said. "For new farming techniques and proposals."

Audrey turned to look at me.

"I could enter something. A real project, not just ideas. Something with research and implementation plans and actual numbers." The idea was forming as I spoke. "Not because my father suggested it. Not to prove Ray wrong. Just because I want to."

"Would you do it even if your father dismissed it? Even if Ray mocked you? Even if the whole town thought you were wasting your time?"

The question hung in the summer air.

Would I?

If I got no approval, no validation, no recognition—would I still want to do the work of figuring out how to modernize the Turner farm? Would I still believe it mattered?

I thought about working on that irrigation pump. The satisfaction of solving the problem, making it better. Nobody had been watching or praising me. I'd done it because the problem was there and I could fix it.

That was choosing.

"Yeah," I said. "I would."

Audrey smiled, and it was the first real smile I'd seen from her all morning. "Then do it. Commit. Not halfway, not contingent on anyone's reaction. Actually commit to the work for its own sake."

"And if my father still doesn't see me? If the town still thinks I'm a screwup?"

"Then you'll have done the work anyway. You'll have something real that you built, something that matters to you regardless of what anyone else thinks. That's the foundation, Wade. That's what you build on—what you know about yourself, not what other people believe about you."

I wanted that. God, I wanted that more than I'd wanted anything in a long time. The certainty. The internal foundation that didn't shift every time someone doubted me or dismissed me or waited for me to fail.

"It's going to be hard," I said.

"Yes."

"I'm going to want to quit. To go race or fight or do something easier."

"Probably."

"And I can't do it for you. Or because of you."

"No. You really can't." She met my eyes. "But I believe you can do it for yourself. The question is whether you believe that."

Did I?

Sitting on the edge of the cotton field, hungover and uncertain, I didn't know if I believed in myself. But I wanted to try. Really try. Not halfhearted trying, hedging my bets. Real trying. The kind that meant falling and getting back up anyway.

"I want to," I said. "I want to believe I can."

"That's a start," Audrey said.

We stood up, brushed grass from our clothes. The sun was high now, the day hot and clear. The county fair was four weeks away.

I had work to do. Real work. The kind that built something instead of tearing it down.

"Thank you," I said to Audrey. "For not letting me off easy."

"You wouldn't respect me if I did."

She was right.

We walked back to the farmhouse together, and with each step I felt something shifting. Not fixed—I wasn't fixed. But moving. Choosing to move instead of just reacting.

It was a start.

And maybe a start was enough.
