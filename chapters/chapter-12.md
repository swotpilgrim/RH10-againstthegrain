# Chapter 12: Dreams He Didn't Know He Had

Late night at the overlook, stars bright overhead, Audrey and I sat on my tailgate talking about futures. Real futures, not the vague "someday" I usually dealt in.

"So I've been looking at colleges," she said. "Georgia Tech has a good agricultural engineering program. I could commute from here, stay with my dad, keep costs down."

Agricultural engineering. A degree that combined her love of mechanical systems with practical application. It fit her perfectly.

"That sounds good," I said.

"What about you?"

"What about me?"

"Wade." She turned to face me. "You can't keep deflecting forever. What do you actually want to do? Not what you don't want—what you do want."

The question I'd been avoiding for years. I'd spent so long defining myself by what I was against that articulating what I was for felt impossible.

"I don't know," I started.

"Yes, you do. You've been thinking about it since the implement show. I can see it." She waited, patient as always.

I took a breath, feeling like I was standing on the edge of something. "If I could do anything?"

"Yeah."

The words had been forming in my head for weeks, maybe longer, but saying them out loud felt like stepping off a cliff. "I'd want to run a different kind of farm." The confession felt strange coming out, like admitting a secret I'd been keeping even from myself. "Not corporate farming where it's all about maximum yield and profit margins and treating the land like a factory. And not just copying what my grandfather did, doing things the same way because that's how it's always been done. But innovative farming. Small-scale sustainable practices, modern techniques, proving you can honor tradition while still adapting to new challenges."

Audrey smiled in the starlight, and I could see the encouragement there. "Keep going."

And so I did, the dam breaking. "I'd want to show farmers—especially family farmers like my dad—that modernizing doesn't mean abandoning your roots or betraying your heritage. That you can use pivot irrigation and soil conservation techniques and hybrid seeds while still working the same land your family's worked for generations, still maintaining that connection to place and history. That innovation and tradition aren't enemies." I was talking faster now, the ideas spilling out like water I'd been holding back too long. "I'd want to be the bridge between the old ways and the new ones. Help family farms stay competitive without losing what makes them family farms—the personal connection to the land, the pride in producing quality instead of just quantity, the legacy passed down through generations."

"That's specific."

"Yeah." I laughed, surprised at myself. "I've been thinking about it. A lot."

"What would you need to make that happen?"

I'd thought about that too, late at night when I couldn't sleep, lying in bed staring at the ceiling and mapping out possibilities instead of just dwelling on problems. "Education, first. I'd need to learn the business side—how agricultural equipment companies work, how to evaluate new technologies, what actually makes financial sense for small operations versus what just sounds good in theory. And the science behind sustainable practices—soil chemistry, water management, integrated pest management, all the technical stuff I'd need to know to implement things correctly instead of just guessing."

Audrey nodded, listening carefully.

"Practical experience too," I continued, the plan solidifying as I spoke it out loud. "Maybe work with Mr. Palmer's company for a while, see how agricultural innovation actually happens from the business side. Learn how to talk to farmers about change, how to overcome resistance, how to demonstrate value. Then come back here, work the Turner farm, start implementing what I've learned on a small scale. Prove the concepts work before trying to scale up."

"And your dad would let you do all that?"

"He said so. Told me if I choose to stay and work the farm, he wants it to be because I want to, not because he guilted me into it. And that if I do stay, I can modernize however I think best. He'll support the changes as long as I can show they make sense." I shook my head, still amazed by that conversation. "It was like talking to a different person. Or maybe seeing the same person clearly for the first time."

"That's huge, Wade."

"I know." The weight of Pa's trust felt heavier than his disappointment ever had—more responsibility, more expectation, but the good kind. The kind that said he believed I could do this instead of the kind that said I was failing at what I should already be doing. "It's scary, actually choosing something and committing to it. What if I fail? What if I implement all these changes and they don't work, or I can't make them profitable, or I ruin what took my family three generations to build?"

"What if you succeed?"

"That's scarier."

Audrey laughed. "How is success scarier than failure?"

"Because if I fail, I can say it wasn't meant to be, go find something else. But if I succeed..." I picked at the rust on my tailgate. "If I succeed, I'm choosing this life. This town, this farm, all of it. I'm choosing to stay."

"And that terrifies you."

"Yeah."

She was quiet for a moment. "You know what I think? I think you've been scared of staying because you thought staying meant surrendering. Giving up who you are to become who your father wanted. But that's not what you're describing. You're describing building something that's yours within a framework that's already there."

"Like you did. Leaving Atlanta but not running from it."

"Exactly. I didn't reject everything about Atlanta or my family. I just chose which parts to keep and which to leave behind." She swung her legs. "You can do the same. Keep the parts of farming and tradition that matter, leave behind the parts that don't fit."

As she said it, something clicked into place. I didn't have to choose between honoring my heritage and being myself. I could do both—take what three generations of Turners had built and add my own layer to it.

"You make it sound simple," I said.

"It's not simple. But it's possible." She looked at me. "So what's the actual plan? Assuming you're serious about this."

I took a breath. "Finish high school. Take Mr. Palmer up on his apprenticeship offer, learn the business side of agricultural equipment. Maybe take some agriculture classes at the junior college. Start small on the Turner farm—implement one or two innovations, prove they work. Build from there."

"That's a real plan."

"Yeah." And saying it out loud made it feel real in a way thinking about it never had.

"You're going to need to tell your dad. Actually tell him, not just hint at it."

"I know."

"Soon."

"I will." I would. The idea didn't fill me with dread anymore. Pa had offered me a choice, and I was choosing. That felt like solid ground instead of quicksand.

We sat in comfortable silence, looking at the valley below. Our valley—not a prison anymore, but a canvas. All that land, all that potential, waiting for someone to see it differently.

"Can I tell you something?" I asked.

"Always."

"When my mom died, I thought I lost the only person who believed in me. My dad was so buried in grief and work, and I was just this angry kid breaking everything I touched. I spent five years thinking nobody would ever see past that."

"And now?"

"Now I've got you. And my dad, trying. And Mr. Palmer offering opportunities. And even Tommy, sticking by me when I gave him every reason to walk away." I looked at her. "I'm not alone in this. That makes it less scary."

"You were never alone. You just thought you were."

She was probably right. All those people who'd been there—Diane at the diner, Tommy at the drag strip, even Pa in his awkward way—I'd been so focused on who wasn't there that I missed who was.

"Thank you," I said.

"For what?"

"For asking the hard questions. For not letting me hide behind easy answers. For showing me there's a middle ground between running and surrendering." I bumped her shoulder with mine. "For being my friend."

"Friends help each other see possibilities." She smiled. "Besides, you fixed my car. I owe you."

"Pretty sure we're past that debt."

"Okay, then I'm doing it because I want to. Because I like who you are when you're honest. Because watching you figure this out has been watching someone become themselves, and that's pretty cool."

My throat went tight. Nobody had ever said anything like that to me before.

"You're going to do great things, Wade Turner," Audrey said quietly. "Not because you're running from your past, but because you're building on it. That's real courage."

I didn't know if I believed her completely. But I wanted to try. Wanted to be the person she saw when she looked at me—someone figuring it out, someone choosing, someone brave enough to hope.

We drove back to town slowly, and I thought about the future I'd just articulated. Agricultural innovation. Sustainable farming. Bridging old and new. It wasn't escape, but it wasn't surrender either.

It was mine. My choice, my path, my dream.

And for the first time in five years, I had a dream specific enough to chase.
