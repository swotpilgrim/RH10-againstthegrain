# Chapter 13: The Cost of Change

The following week, I started actually doing the research instead of just thinking about it. Checked out books from the Oakdale library on sustainable farming practices, soil conservation, water management. Read agricultural journals Mr. Palmer lent me, took notes, started sketching out what changes might work on the Turner farm.

Marcus noticed. How could he not? I was suddenly paying attention when he talked about crop yields and market prices, asking questions instead of tuning him out, taking an interest in the very thing I'd been fighting against for five years.

My brother James noticed too. Tuesday afternoon while we were working on fence posts together, he finally said something.

"What's going on with you?"

"What do you mean?"

"You know what I mean. You're different. Reading farming journals, talking to Dad about irrigation systems, actually showing up for work on time." He hammered in a post. "The city girl got you domesticated?"

The comment stung more than it should have. "Audrey didn't make me do anything."

"Didn't say she did. Just saying you've changed."

"Is that a problem?"

"No." He looked at me. "Just wondering if you're doing it for you or for her."

The question hit home because I'd been asking myself the same thing. Was this real change or was I just performing it to impress Audrey? To prove I wasn't the disappointing son everyone thought I was?

"For me," I said, but even I heard the uncertainty in my voice.

James heard it too. "You sure about that?"

I went back to hammering posts, but his words circled in my head. Was I changing for myself or just changing the performance? Trading rebel for reformed, but still playing a role instead of being real?

At the library Wednesday, I ran into Tommy. He looked at the stack of agricultural books I was checking out and raised an eyebrow.

"Seriously?"

"I'm researching."

"For what? A school project you didn't tell me about?"

"For me. For the farm."

Tommy sat down at one of the library tables, gestured for me to join him. I did, reluctantly.

"Talk to me," he said. "What's going on? You've been different lately. Not bad different, just... different. And I want to make sure you're okay."

"I'm fine."

"Wade. Come on. We've been friends since third grade. I know when something's up."

I set the books down. "I'm trying to figure things out. What I want, what I'm good at, where I fit. Is that so weird?"

"No. But it's weird that you're doing it through farming when you've spent five years saying you hate farming."

"I don't hate farming. I hate feeling like I don't have a choice."

"And now you have a choice?"

"Dad gave me one. Said if I stay and work the farm, it's because I choose to, and I can modernize however I want. If I go, he'll support that too."

Tommy nodded slowly. "And Audrey?"

"What about her?"

"Is she part of this? The reason you're suddenly interested in agricultural innovation?"

I wanted to say no, but that wasn't honest. "She helped me see it differently. Showed me there's middle ground between running away and surrendering. But I'm not doing this for her."

"You sure?"

"Why does everyone keep asking me that?"

"Because change for someone else doesn't stick. You'll resent them eventually, blame them for making you be someone you're not." Tommy picked up one of my library books, flipped through it. "I just want to make sure you're doing this because you want to, not because you're trying to be who Audrey needs you to be."

The words hit harder because they were probably true. I had been trying to be better, trying to figure things out, but how much of that was genuine and how much was performance?

Friday night at the drag strip felt like a test. A measuring stick for whether I'd actually changed or was just pretending.

I showed up later than usual, the sun already setting, and found the regular guys already racing. Engines roaring, tires screaming, the familiar smell of burned rubber and gasoline thick in the air. Tommy was there with his Ford, Jake Morrison with his rebuilt Chevy, a few other guys from school and surrounding towns. And Ray Coleman, of course, leaning against his truck with that smug expression I'd learned to hate over the years.

He saw me pull up and his eyes lit up like he'd been waiting for this moment.

"Look who finally showed up," Ray called out loud enough for everyone to hear. "Thought maybe you'd gotten too good for us, Turner. Too refined now. Heard you've been reading books about farming like some kind of scholar instead of actually doing the work."

A month ago—hell, two weeks ago—I would've thrown a punch. The old Wade, the one who solved every problem with his fists and wore his anger like armor, would've crossed that distance in three strides and made Ray regret every word. Would've welcomed the excuse, honestly. The release of violence, the simplicity of physical confrontation where the only question was who could hit harder.

Instead, I just looked at him. Felt the old anger rise, then watched it crest and fall like a wave that didn't quite reach shore. "Yeah, I've been reading."

"Pathetic. The city girl's got you whipped good. Domesticated. Next thing you know, you'll be going to church every Sunday and joining the 4-H club."

"Ray, shut up," Tommy said from where he stood by his truck.

But I didn't need Tommy to defend me. Didn't need to prove anything to Ray or anyone else watching this little scene. "Think what you want, Ray. Doesn't matter to me."

I walked away, and behind me I heard Ray laugh. "See? Whipped."

The old anger flared—hot and familiar and easy. Part of me wanted to turn around, wanted to fight, wanted to prove I was still the same Wade Turner who didn't take anyone's crap.

But I kept walking.

Tommy caught up with me by my truck. "You okay?"

"Yeah."

"You didn't hit him."

"Didn't need to."

"That's... different."

"I know." And I did. Old Wade would've fought. New Wade—or maybe real Wade, the one I was trying to become—didn't need to.

But was that growth or just suppression? Was I actually changing or just controlling the same rage in a different way?

I climbed into my truck, but I was too keyed up to drive. Sat there with my hands on the steering wheel, trying to sort through what I was feeling.

Audrey found me twenty minutes later. I don't know how she knew I was there—maybe Tommy called her—but she appeared at my window like she'd been summoned.

"Hey," she said.

"Hey."

She climbed into the passenger seat without asking. "Tommy said Ray was being Ray."

"Yeah."

"And you didn't fight him."

"No."

"How do you feel about that?"

The question was so Audrey—direct, honest, cutting through to what mattered. "I don't know. Proud, maybe? That I walked away. But also... I don't know. Weak?"

"Walking away isn't weak."

"Feels like it sometimes. Like I'm suppressing who I am to be who everyone wants me to be."

"Is that what you're doing?"

"I don't know!" The words came out louder than I meant. "I don't know if I'm actually changing or just performing change. I don't know if I want to farm or if I just want you to think I'm not wasted potential. I don't know if not fighting makes me mature or just scared."

Audrey was quiet for a moment. Then she said, "Can I tell you what I see?"

"Yeah."

"I see someone trying really hard to figure himself out. Not perfectly, not without doubt, but genuinely. You're reading about farming because you're interested, not because I told you to. You're having real conversations with your dad instead of just fighting. You didn't hit Ray because you didn't want to, not because you thought you shouldn't."

"How do you know that?"

"Because I've watched you. When you're performing, you're stiff. Defensive. But when you're real—like when you're talking about irrigation systems or showing me around Oakdale—you're relaxed. Yourself." She turned to face me. "Change is uncomfortable, Wade. It's supposed to be. But that doesn't mean it's fake."

"What if I'm doing it wrong?"

"There's no wrong way to figure yourself out. There's just doing it or not doing it."

I let that sink in. Maybe she was right. Maybe the doubt wasn't proof I was failing—maybe it was just proof I was trying.

"Ray called me whipped," I said.

"Are you?"

"No."

"Then why do you care what he thinks?"

Good question. Why did I care? Ray Coleman's opinion shouldn't matter. But it did, because part of me was still that angry kid who defined himself by opposition. Who needed someone to fight against to know who he was.

"I'm trying not to care," I said.

"That's all anyone can do. Try."

We sat there in comfortable silence, and gradually the anger faded. The old Wade would've carried it all night, let it fester, maybe gone looking for a fight to burn it off. But this Wade—whoever I was becoming—could just let it go.

That had to mean something.
