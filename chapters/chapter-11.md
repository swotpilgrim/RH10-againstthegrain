# Chapter 11: The Possibility of Different

I couldn't stop thinking about what Audrey had said—that maybe I'd been rebelling against the wrong thing. That maybe it wasn't farming I hated but the cage of doing it exactly like it'd always been done.

Early July, I started paying attention different. When Pa talked about crop yields, I actually listened instead of tuning him out. When the old cultivator broke down, I didn't just fix it the minimum way—I researched whether there were better parts, more efficient systems.

Pa noticed. Didn't say anything at first, just watched me with this careful expression like he didn't want to spook whatever was happening.

One afternoon, I was in the machinery barn studying a manual on pivot irrigation systems when he appeared in the doorway.

"That Mr. Palmer's literature?" he asked.

"Yeah. He lent it to me." I didn't look up from the diagrams. "The new systems use half the water and cover twice the ground. Initial investment's high, but pays for itself in three years."

Pa walked closer, looked over my shoulder. "You've been researching this."

"Some."

"Why?"

The question hung there. I could've given a dozen deflecting answers. Instead, I told the truth.

"Because I'm interested. Not in farming the way we do it now, but in this. Problem-solving. Finding better ways. Innovation." I finally looked at him. "I don't hate farming, Pa. I hate feeling like there's only one right way to do it, and if I don't want to do it exactly that way, I'm wrong."

He was quiet for a long time. Then he sat down on the workbench across from me.

"Your grandfather farmed the same way his father did," Pa said slowly. "Crop rotation, traditional methods, what worked for generations. When I suggested pivot irrigation back in the seventies, he said I was wasting money on newfangled nonsense."

I blinked. "You wanted to modernize?"

"I wanted to improve. There's a difference, but he didn't see it." Pa picked up the manual, flipped through it. "He was so focused on honoring tradition that he couldn't see innovation and tradition don't have to be enemies."

This was the most honest conversation we'd had in years. I didn't want to break it.

"What happened?" I asked.

"I waited. Worked the farm his way until he died, then made the changes I'd been planning for years. Modernized irrigation, changed the crop rotation, invested in better equipment." He set the manual down. "Made the farm more profitable in five years than it'd been in twenty."

"Why didn't you ever tell me this?"

"Because by the time you were old enough to care, we were already fighting about everything else." He sighed. "I saw you pulling away from the farm, and I thought pushing harder was the answer. Making you understand the value of tradition. But all I did was make you hate it more."

"I don't hate it," I said quietly. "I just don't want to be trapped by it."

"I know. Took me too long to see that." He stood up, walked to the barn door, looked out at the fields. "Mr. Palmer stopped by yesterday. Said you've shown real aptitude for agricultural systems thinking. Asked if I'd mind him offering you some kind of informal apprenticeship."

My chest tightened. "What'd you say?"

"I said it was your decision." He turned to face me. "Wade, I've spent five years trying to make you want what I want. Trying to force you into a mold you don't fit. And all it did was push you away and make us both miserable."

"Pa—"

"Let me finish." He held up a hand. "You're smart. Good with systems, good with solving problems. Whether you use that here on this farm or somewhere else in agricultural equipment or some completely different field, that's your choice. Not mine."

I stared at him. "You're saying I can leave?"

"I'm saying you get to choose. If you choose to stay and work this farm, I want it to be because you want to, not because I guilted you into it. If you choose to go, I want you to know this land will always be here, and so will I."

Something in my throat went tight. "I don't know what I want yet."

"Then figure it out. Take Mr. Palmer up on his offer. Learn about the business side. See what's out there. And when you know, tell me. Whatever you decide, we'll make it work."

He walked out, leaving me sitting there with the irrigation manual and a completely different view of my father than I'd had an hour ago.

That weekend, I drove to the farm implement show in the next county with Audrey. Mr. Palmer had invited us—said it'd be good exposure to modern agricultural technology.

The place was huge—bigger than I'd expected. Massive tractors that dwarfed anything we had on the Turner farm, combine harvesters with technology I'd only read about, irrigation systems laid out in full working demonstrations, soil testing equipment that looked like something from a science lab, sustainable farming displays showcasing the future of agriculture. Hundreds of farmers and agricultural professionals walking around, discussing innovations and efficiency and yield improvements like it was the most exciting thing in the world. And maybe it was.

"This is incredible," Audrey said, studying a display on crop rotation systems.

"Yeah." I was looking at a pivot irrigation setup similar to what I'd been researching. The salesman saw my interest and came over.

"Interested in modernizing your operation?" he asked.

"Maybe. My family's got a three-hundred-acre farm. Cotton and tobacco, mostly."

"Perfect size for this system. Let me show you the numbers."

He walked me through water savings, coverage efficiency, cost-benefit analysis. Audrey stood beside me asking smart questions about installation and maintenance. The salesman assumed we were a young farming couple planning our future, and neither of us corrected him.

After, we walked through more displays. Sustainable pest management. Hybrid seeds resistant to drought. Soil conservation techniques. Every booth represented a different way to approach farming—not abandoning tradition but adapting it.

"You're smiling," Audrey observed.

"Am I?"

"Yeah. Real smile, not the defensive smirk. You're actually enjoying this."

She was right. I was. Because this wasn't my father's farming or my grandfather's farming. This was problem-solving farming. Innovation farming. The kind where I could engage my brain instead of just my back.

"I didn't know this existed," I admitted. "Farming that's about finding better ways instead of just repeating what's always been done."

"That's because you were so busy fighting against farming you never looked at what modern farming could be."

We stopped at a booth for Mr. Palmer's company. He was there talking to a farmer about equipment financing, but he saw us and waved.

"What do you think?" he asked when the farmer left.

"It's a lot," I said.

"Good lot or overwhelming lot?"

"Good lot. Different than I expected."

"Agriculture's changing, Wade. Farms that adapt thrive. Ones that don't..." He shrugged. "Your generation will decide what farming looks like in twenty years. Young people who understand both the tradition and the innovation, who can bridge the old ways and the new—they're going to lead the industry."

"I'm not sure I'm leader material."

"Why not? You're smart, you understand systems, you've got practical experience, and according to Audrey, you ask the right questions." He handed me a business card. "Think about shadowing me this summer. A few days a week, learn the business side. See if it fits."

I took the card. "Thank you, sir."

"Don't thank me. Just show up if you're interested." He went back to his booth, and Audrey and I wandered through the rest of the show.

On the drive home, Audrey asked, "So?"

"So what?"

"Are you going to take him up on it?"

"I don't know. Maybe." I turned onto the highway toward Oakdale. "It's weird. A month ago, anything connected to farming felt like a trap. But this..." I gestured back toward where the show had been. "This feels like possibility."

"That's because it is. You're not fighting against your roots anymore. You're figuring out how to grow from them in your own direction."

"When'd you get so wise?"

"Told you. Practice and mistakes." She rolled down her window, let the wind blow through. "You know what I think?"

"What?"

"I think you've been so focused on what you're against that you never looked at what you could be for. But now you're looking. And that's the hard part—actually choosing something instead of just rejecting everything."

She was right. Choosing felt scarier than rejecting. Rejecting was safe—you couldn't fail at not wanting something. But choosing? Choosing meant hoping. And hoping meant risking disappointment.

But sitting there in my truck with Audrey beside me and the memory of that implement show fresh in my mind, I thought maybe the risk was worth it.

Maybe there was a middle ground between my grandfather's traditional farming and complete escape. Maybe I could honor where I came from while still choosing my own direction.

Maybe different didn't mean betrayal.

Maybe it just meant growth.
