# Chapter 4: Something Different

Monday morning I showed up to school on time, suspension over. The hallways buzzed—locker doors slamming, girls laughing, guys shoving each other. I kept my head down.

"Did you hear? There's a new girl. From Atlanta."

"I heard she's really pretty."

I kept walking. New kids showed up in Oakdale maybe once every couple years. They never stayed long. Soon as they figured out how small this town was, they'd leave. I'd seen it enough times to know the pattern.

First period English dragged. Second period shop class was better—actually working on things instead of just reading. I was rebuilding a carburetor when the buzz started up again.

"That's her," someone said near the door. "The new girl."

I glanced up despite myself.

She stood in the parking lot, leaning against a blue Ford, studying a map. Dark hair pulled back, clothes that didn't quite match Oakdale style. She held herself different—not nervous or eager to fit in. Just calm, focused.

"Think someone should tell her where stuff is?" Jake Morrison asked.

"Probably." But nobody moved.

I turned back to my carburetor. Not my problem.

By lunch, the new girl was all anyone talked about. I grabbed my tray and headed for my corner table. Halfway there, I saw her.

She sat alone with a book open, eating cafeteria food like it didn't taste like cardboard, unbothered by the stares around her. Most new kids scrambled to make friends. This girl looked perfectly content.

I sat down and tried not to watch her. Failed.

She was reading something thick—a manual, not a novel. Making notes in the margin. Nobody else looked that comfortable being alone.

"That's Audrey Palmer," Tommy said, dropping into the seat across from me. "From Atlanta. Her dad's with some agricultural equipment company."

"Good for them."

"She's in my history class. Actually knows the answers when called on."

I ate my sandwich.

"You should talk to her," Tommy said.

"Why?"

"Because you've got that look. Same one you get working on engines."

"I don't have a look."

"Sure." He stole one of my chips. "She's new. Doesn't know your reputation yet. Fresh start, if you wanted one."

"I don't."

But I watched Audrey turn a page, completely absorbed, and wondered what it was like to be that self-contained. To not care what anyone thought.

The afternoon dragged—chemistry, history, study hall. When the bell finally rang, I grabbed my jacket and headed for the parking lot. Hot June afternoon, my truck would be an oven. Halfway across the lot, I saw her again.

Audrey Palmer stood with her car's hood up, hands on her hips, frowning at the engine like it had personally offended her. The blue Ford wasn't running—I could tell by the silence and the frustrated set of her shoulders.

I should've walked past. Should've gotten in my truck and driven home and not gotten involved with the new girl from Atlanta who'd be gone in six months anyway.

Instead, I stopped.

She was leaning over the engine now, actually looking at it instead of just staring helplessly like most people did when cars broke down. She had grease on her hands already, which meant she'd been touching things, trying to figure it out.

I walked over. "Car trouble?"

She straightened up, turned to look at me. Up close, her eyes were gray, steady and direct. She didn't do that thing some girls did—look away, smile shy, act helpless. Just met my gaze head-on.

"Distributor cap, I think," she said. "It was running rough this morning, and now it won't turn over at all."

I blinked. Most girls in Oakdale couldn't name a single engine part. "You know about distributors?"

"My dad taught me. He says everyone should understand how their vehicle works." She gestured at the engine. "But understanding and fixing aren't always the same thing."

"Fair enough." I set my bag down and leaned in to look. "Let me check."

She stepped back to give me room, and I started running through the obvious culprits. Pulled the distributor cap—sure enough, it was cracked. Hairline fracture, easy to miss, but enough to cause problems.

"You were right," I said, showing her the crack. "Distributor cap's done."

"Can it be fixed?"

"Needs replacing. You got a spare?"

"No. I didn't even know I needed to carry one." She frowned at the cap in my hand. "How much does a replacement cost?"

"Depends. For this model, probably ten bucks at the auto parts store. I can rig something temporary if you've got electrical tape, get you home at least."

Her eyebrows went up. "You can do that?"

"Yeah." I pulled my keys out. "Got tape in my truck."

I grabbed the electrical tape from my toolbox and came back, wrapped the cracked cap carefully. It wouldn't hold forever, but it'd get her through a drive home. While I worked, she watched, actually paying attention to what I was doing.

"Why does that work?" she asked.

"Distributor cap needs to keep the electrical current directed to the right spark plugs. Crack lets current leak. Tape seals it temporarily, stops the leak." I tightened it back into place. "Try it now."

She slid into the driver's seat and turned the key. The engine coughed, hesitated, then caught. Not smooth, but running.

"That's amazing," she said, cutting the engine and getting out. "Thank you. How much do I owe you?"

"Nothing."

"I should pay you something. You fixed my car."

"It's electrical tape and five minutes. Don't worry about it."

She studied me with those steady gray eyes, like she was trying to figure something out. "What's your name?"

"Wade. Wade Turner."

"I'm Audrey Palmer." She held out her hand, formal and direct.

I shook it, surprised. Her grip was firm, not limp like she expected me to do all the work.

"You know anything else about engines, Wade Turner?" she asked.

"Some."

"More than some, I'm guessing." She tilted her head. "Where'd you learn?"

"Around. My dad's a farmer, so there's always equipment breaking down. And I rebuilt my truck from scrap, so I had to figure out how everything worked."

"The black Chevy?"

"Yeah."

"That's impressive." And she said it like she meant it, not like she was flirting or trying to butter me up. Just stating a fact.

I didn't know what to do with that, so I grabbed my bag. "You should get that cap replaced soon as you can. This won't hold more than a day or two."

"Where's the auto parts store?"

"Main Street, across from the hardware store. Harper's Auto Parts. Tell them you need a distributor cap for a—" I glanced at her car again. "Fifty-four Ford. They'll know which one."

"Thank you." She paused. "Can I ask you something else?"

"Sure."

"Do you know where the good diners are in this town? I've been eating cafeteria food and gas station sandwiches since we got here."

The question caught me off-guard. "Harper's Diner on Main Street. Only real option in Oakdale, but the food's decent."

"Would you want to show me sometime? As a thank you for fixing my car?"

I stared at her. Was she asking me out? Or just being friendly? I couldn't tell. Her expression didn't give anything away—just calm and direct and waiting for an answer.

"Maybe," I heard myself say.

"Okay." She smiled, just a little. "Thanks again for the help, Wade."

She got in her car and drove off, the engine running rough but functional. I stood there in the parking lot with my bag and my confusion, trying to figure out what had just happened.

Tommy appeared from nowhere, grinning like an idiot. "What was that?"

"She had car trouble."

"And?"

"And I helped her fix it."

"Wade. Come on. She just asked you to dinner."

"She asked if I'd show her the diner. That's different."

"Is it?" Tommy shook his head. "Man, for a guy who's good with engines, you're terrible with people."

"Shut up."

"I'm just saying. The new girl who doesn't know you're supposedly trouble just asked you out, and you said maybe. Maybe? Who says maybe?"

"I do." I unlocked my truck. "She'll be gone in six months anyway. Everyone leaves Oakdale."

"Yeah, but she's here now." Tommy headed for his own vehicle. "And she doesn't know your reputation yet. Like I said—fresh start, if you want it."

I climbed into my truck and sat there a minute before starting the engine. Through the windshield, I could see the empty spot where Audrey's Ford had been.

She didn't know my reputation. Didn't know I was the rebel son, the disappointment, the troublemaker. To her, I was just some guy who fixed her distributor cap. Some guy who knew about engines.

It was strange, being seen as just... me. Not Wade Turner, Marcus Turner's problem. Just Wade.

I kind of liked it.

I drove home with the windows down, and for the first time in a while, the weight on my chest felt a little lighter. Maybe because for five minutes in a parking lot, I got to be someone other than who this town decided I was.

Maybe that was worth something.

Or maybe Tommy was right, and I was terrible with people, and I'd just blown a chance at something different by saying maybe instead of yes.

Either way, something had shifted. Something small, something I couldn't quite name yet.

But it felt like possibility, and I hadn't felt that in a long time.
