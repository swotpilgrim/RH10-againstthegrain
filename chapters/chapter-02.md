# Chapter 2: The Weight of Three Generations

Saturday morning came with Pa knocking on my door at five-thirty, same as he did every weekend. No suspension from farm work, no reprieve from responsibility. I dragged myself out of bed, muscles still sore from yesterday's chores, and pulled on clothes that already smelled like sweat and dirt.

James's truck was parked in the yard by the time I made it downstairs, the bed already loaded with hay bales. My brother stood with Pa by the barn, both of them holding coffee mugs, talking low. They looked alike from a distance—same broad shoulders, same way of standing with weight on one leg like they were rooted to the ground. The only real difference was James smiled more. Had a reason to.

"Morning," James called when he saw me. His wedding ring caught the early sunlight, gold and deliberate. A promise kept. "Pa says we're working the south field today."

"Yeah." I grabbed work gloves from the barn hook and followed them out.

We worked in a row—Pa, James, me—turning soil that'd been planted and harvested by Turners since before I was born. The sun climbed higher, turning the morning from bearable to brutal. Georgia in late May didn't mess around. By eight o'clock, my shirt was soaked through.

James worked steady, mechanical, like he'd been born knowing how to move through these rows. Maybe he had. Five years older than me, he'd never gone through a rebellious phase, never questioned whether this life was what he wanted. He just accepted it, married Beth Miller from church, and settled into being the son Pa could be proud of.

"So what're you thinking for after graduation?" James asked during a water break, both of us standing in the shade of Pa's truck. "That's coming up quick. Two weeks?"

"Three." I drank deep from my canteen, not meeting his eyes.

"You apply anywhere? Colleges, trade schools?"

"Nope."

James was quiet a moment. I could feel him choosing his words careful, the way you approached a spooked horse. "You got plans at all?"

"Leave Oakdale. That's the plan."

"Leave and go where?"

I shrugged. Didn't have an answer that wouldn't sound stupid out loud. Leave and go anywhere. Leave and figure it out. Leave and be someone other than the disappointing son of Marcus Turner.

"Wade." James sighed, and I heard Pa in that sigh. "You can't just run off with no direction. You need money, you need work, you need—"

"I'll figure it out."

"The farm's gonna be ours someday. Mine and yours. You could make a real living here, build something—"

"I don't want it." The words came out harder than I meant. "I never wanted it, James. I know that kills Pa, know it makes me the bad son, but I can't fake it just to make everybody happy."

James studied me, his expression unreadable. "It's not about making people happy. It's about honoring what came before. Three generations of Turners worked this land. Died on this land. That means something."

"To you." I screwed the cap back on my canteen. "Not to me."

"Then what does mean something to you?"

I didn't have an answer for that either. The things that meant something to me—driving fast, the satisfaction of fixing an engine, the drag strip races where for a few minutes I felt alive—none of that sounded substantial when you said it out loud. None of that built a future.

"That's what I thought," James said quietly when I stayed silent. He headed back to the field, and I followed, the space between us feeling wider than it had that morning.

Pa called for a break around noon, sent James home for lunch with Beth. I stayed, partly because I wasn't hungry and partly because I knew what was coming. Soon as James's truck disappeared down the drive, Pa turned to me.

"Irrigation pump's still making that noise. You checked it yesterday but I think the problem's deeper than you got to. Want you to take it apart properly, figure out what's wrong."

I nodded. This was the closest thing to a peace offering Pa knew how to make. Give me something mechanical to fix, something that required thinking instead of just muscle. It was the one thing we had in common—I'd inherited his aptitude for understanding how systems worked, how parts fit together. He just wished I'd apply it to farming instead of rebuilding truck engines in my spare time.

The irrigation pump sat in the equipment barn, a beast of a machine that'd been running since before I was born. I grabbed tools and got to work, removing casings, checking bearings, tracing the problem through the system. It was meditation, this kind of work. My hands knew what to do, my mind could go quiet, and the whole world narrowed down to metal and motion and logic.

The main bearing was shot, ground down from years of use and probably months of running wrong. I pulled it out, examined it, calculated what I'd need to replace it. We had parts in the storage shed—Pa kept inventory of everything—but this particular bearing was old enough that finding an exact match would be tough. I could retrofit something newer, probably work better than the original.

I lost track of time, the way I always did when I was fixing something. Grease under my fingernails, sweat dripping down my back, the satisfaction of solving a problem piece by piece. This was the part of farm work I didn't hate. The mechanical challenges, the problem-solving, making something broken work again. If farming was just this, maybe I wouldn't need to leave.

But it wasn't just this. It was also the endless expectation, the weight of legacy, the feeling of being trapped in a life someone else had chosen for me before I was born.

"How's it coming?"

I looked up to find Pa standing in the barn doorway, backlit by afternoon sun. I'd been working for three hours straight.

"Main bearing's shot," I said, holding up the worn piece. "I can retrofit a newer model, should actually run better than the original. More efficient."

Pa walked closer, examined my work. I saw his eyes track over the disassembled pump, the organized tools, the parts laid out in order. For a second—just a second—something shifted in his expression. Not quite pride, but close. Acknowledgment, maybe. Seeing that I was good at this, that I knew what I was doing.

"This is good work," Pa said finally.

Something in my chest loosened. I waited.

"You could be good at this if you tried," he continued, and just like that, the moment shattered. "If you put half the effort into the farm that you put into that truck of yours, or into causing trouble—"

"I am trying." The words came out flat. "This is me trying."

"This is you doing one thing right for every ten things wrong. That's not trying, Wade. That's just... existing."

I set down the wrench I was holding, slow and deliberate. "What do you want from me?"

"I want you to care." Pa's voice rose, frustration finally breaking through. "About this farm, about this family, about something other than running away. Your brother cares. Your grandfather cared. I care. Why can't you?"

"I don't know!" The words exploded out of me. "I don't know why I can't just be like James, why I can't just accept this and be happy. But I can't. And every time you compare me to him, every time you look at me like I'm a disappointment, it just makes it worse."

"You are a disappointment," Pa said, and the words hit like a physical blow. "Not because you're not like James. Because you've got all this potential and you're wasting it fighting ghosts."

We stared at each other across the barn, dust motes floating in the shaft of sunlight between us. I wanted to argue, wanted to defend myself, but what was the point? He'd already decided who I was. The rebel son. The one who'd break the chain.

"I'll finish the pump tomorrow," I said quietly. "I need parts from town."

I walked out before he could respond, before he could see how much his words had cut. I'd heard them before—different versions of the same theme—but it never stopped hurting. Maybe that was my real problem. I cared too much what he thought, and it was killing me.

The house was empty. I grabbed my truck keys and left, no destination in mind, just the need to move.

I drove the back roads with the windows down and the radio up. Elvis singing about being caught in a trap, and wasn't that perfect. The sun sank lower, and I pushed the speedometer higher than I should've.

This was freedom, or close to it. The truck responding, the road empty, the music loud enough to drown out Pa's voice in my head. Out here, I was just Wade, driving.

I thought about James's question. What meant something to me? What did I want?

I'd spent so long defining myself by what I wasn't—not a farmer, not content, not the son Pa wanted—that I'd never figured out what I was. Running away was easier than running toward something.

But I couldn't keep slamming against the same walls, disappointing the same people. Something had to change.

I just didn't know what.

The roads wound past other farms. The Colemans' place with their new barn. The Birches' feed store. All of them rooted here, generation after generation.

Three generations of Turners had loved this land. And here I was, fourth in line, the one who looked at cotton fields and saw prison bars instead of heritage.

Maybe Pa was right. Maybe I was fighting ghosts—the ghost of Ma, the ghost of the boy I'd been before she died, the ghost of who I was supposed to become.

I drove until full dark, until the stars came out, until the gas gauge dropped low. Then I turned around, headed back to the farm where Pa would be waiting up even if he pretended he wasn't.

The porch light was on when I pulled in. Through the kitchen window, I could see Pa sitting at the table.

I sat in my truck a long moment before going in. Tomorrow I'd get the parts for the irrigation pump. I'd fix it because that was the one thing I could do right. And Pa would find something else to criticize because that was the dance we did.

And I'd keep planning my escape, even if I didn't know where I was escaping to.

The weight of three generations pressed down from above, and I carried it alone into the house.
