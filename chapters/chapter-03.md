# Chapter 3: Reputation Earned and Worn

Sunday mornings in Oakdale meant church. Not a choice—a requirement if your last name was Turner. Pa stood at the bottom of the stairs at eight-thirty sharp, dressed in his good suit. He didn't say anything when I came down, just nodded once and headed for the truck.

James and Beth met us in the parking lot, Beth in a yellow dress, James in a matching tie. They waved. I nodded back and followed Pa through the heavy wooden doors.

Oakdale Community Church smelled like old hymnals and furniture polish. White clapboard, stained glass windows, plaques with family names carved in the entrance. Turner among them.

I headed for the back pew, my usual spot. Pa stopped halfway up the aisle, turned to see where I'd gone, jaw tight. But he didn't say anything. Just kept walking to the third row where Turners had sat for generations. James and Beth slid in beside him.

The church filled up around me. Families in their Sunday best, farmers scrubbed clean, kids squirming in starched clothes. I opened a hymnal and pretended to read, counting minutes until I could leave.

"That's Marcus Turner's boy," someone whispered a few pews up. Mrs. Henderson, probably, the worst gossip in town. "Heard he got suspended from school. Fighting again."

"That poor man." Another voice, dripping sympathy that didn't quite hide the judgment underneath. "After everything he's been through, losing Rebecca, and now Wade turning out like this."

"Some boys are just born with the devil in them, I suppose."

I kept my eyes on the hymnal, on the words I'd memorized years ago. Rock of Ages, cleft for me. Let me hide myself in thee. Ma used to sing this one while cooking Sunday dinner, her voice clear and true. The memory felt like a knife between my ribs.

Pastor Williams took the pulpit and launched into his sermon. Something about honoring thy father and mother, because of course it was. I stopped listening after the first five minutes, just sat there in my back pew and waited for it to be over.

After the service, people filed out slow, stopping to chat in the aisle, making plans for Sunday dinner. I slipped out a side door, headed for Pa's truck to wait. Didn't make it.

"Wade Turner." Ray Coleman's voice stopped me halfway across the parking lot. "Surprised to see you in church. Figured you'd be too busy causing trouble to bother with respecting your elders."

I turned. Ray stood with a couple of his buddies, all of them dressed nice and proper, Ray's fiancée Sarah hanging on his arm. They looked like an advertisement for good Christian living.

"Just here to pray for you, Ray," I said, keeping my voice level. "Figure you need it more than most."

Ray's smile didn't reach his eyes. "That's real cute. Your daddy know you talk like that?"

"My daddy knows exactly who I am."

"Yeah, he does." Ray stepped closer. "Knows you're a disappointment. Knows you've been fighting and racing instead of doing honest work. Knows you're gonna break his heart, same as you broke your mother's."

My hands curled into fists before I could stop them. Ray saw it and his smile widened.

"Go ahead," he said quietly. "Hit me right here in the church parking lot. Prove everybody right about you."

I wanted to. Wanted to wipe that smug expression off his face, wanted to make him hurt the way his words hurt. But Pa was probably watching from somewhere, and the last thing I needed was another reason for him to be ashamed of me.

I uncurled my fists, slow and deliberate. "You're not worth it."

I walked away while Ray laughed behind me, his buddies joining in. My ribs still hurt from the last fight, but that wasn't why my chest felt tight. It was knowing Ray was right. I was a disappointment. Did break my father's heart. And standing here in the church parking lot, surrounded by people who'd known me my whole life and decided exactly who I was, there wasn't anything I could do to change their minds.

Pa drove home in silence, James and Beth following in their truck. Beth had invited us for Sunday dinner, the way she did most weeks. I'd find an excuse to skip. Couldn't stomach watching my brother's perfect life, not today.

By noon I'd changed out of my church clothes and into jeans, told Pa I was heading into town. He didn't ask why. Probably glad to have me gone.

Harper's Diner sat on Main Street between the hardware store and the post office, a fixture in Oakdale longer than I'd been alive. The lunch crowd filled most of the booths—families after church, still dressed nice, kids coloring on paper placemats while parents drank coffee and talked about whose crops looked good this year.

I slid into the back booth, the one by the window where I could see the street. Alone. Always alone in a room full of people who'd known me since I was born.

Diane Harper appeared beside the table, coffee pot in hand. Sixteen, same as half the girls in my class, but different. Saw people instead of reputations.

"Hey, Wade." She flipped over my coffee cup and poured. "Rough morning?"

"Church."

"Say no more." She grinned. "You want your usual?"

"Yeah, thanks."

She started to turn away, then stopped. "How are you doing? Really?"

Brown eyes, genuine concern. Not polite gossip-fishing. Real worry.

"I'm fine."

"Liar." But gentle, not mean. "I heard about the suspension. Saw Ray giving you grief in the parking lot too."

"You were at church?"

"Dropping off Mama's bake sale contribution. Ray's a piece of work. Don't let him get to you."

"Little late for that."

Diane studied me a moment. "You know what I remember? When your mama died, you were twelve years old, and you sat at this exact booth for three hours after the funeral. Didn't eat, didn't talk, just sat here. I brought you about six refills of Coke, and finally you looked at me and said thank you. That's what I remember when people talk about Wade Turner causing trouble. I remember the kid who said thank you."

Something in my throat went tight. "That was a long time ago."

"Five years isn't that long." She tucked her order pad in her apron pocket. "You're not as bad as people think, Wade. You're just angry. There's a difference."

She walked away before I could respond, disappearing into the kitchen. I sat there with my coffee, her words circling in my head. Angry. Yeah, I was angry. Angry at Pa for not understanding me, angry at Ma for dying, angry at this town for deciding who I was before I got a chance to figure it out myself.

But being angry didn't build anything. Just burned bridges I might need someday.

I ate lunch alone, paid Diane, and headed out. The afternoon stretched ahead, empty and hot. I drove home, grabbed what I needed, and by eight o'clock I was at the drag strip.

The strip wasn't official—just abandoned highway outside town. On weekend nights, guys gathered with their trucks, money and pride on the line.

Tommy Birch leaned against his Ford, smoking. "Wondered if you'd show."

"Where else would I be?"

"Church? Sunday dinner?" He grinned, knowing the answer.

"Did that already. Went great."

"That good, huh?" He flicked ash. "You racing tonight?"

"That's why I'm here."

"Wade." His tone shifted. "You've been driving crazy lately. Taking risks you don't need. What's going on?"

"I'm fine."

"You don't look fine. You look like a guy trying to crash."

"Maybe I am."

"That's not funny."

"Wasn't joking." I grabbed my wallet. "You racing or playing mother hen?"

Tommy sighed but didn't push it. We walked over to where guys were setting up races, money changing hands, engines revving. Gasoline and burned rubber, motors pushed to their limit. The only thing that mattered was speed.

I put my money down, lined up against Jake Morrison's Chevy. We'd raced before. Tonight I didn't care. I just needed to drive.

The flag dropped. I floored it, the truck responding with a roar that drowned out everything else. Beside me, Jake kept pace. I pushed harder, engine screaming, speedometer climbing past safe into reckless. The world narrowed to the road ahead, to the truck vibrating around me, to the pure adrenaline of going fast enough that nothing else mattered.

I crossed the finish line half a length ahead, braked hard, and sat there with the engine ticking in the sudden quiet. My hands shook on the steering wheel.

I won. But it felt hollow, same as everything else.

Tommy appeared at my window. "You won."

"Yeah."

"You also almost lost control in that last curve. I watched your backend fishtail."

"But I didn't."

"Wade." Tommy's voice was tight. "You're gonna wrap this truck around a tree one night, and I'm gonna be the one who has to tell your dad they found pieces of you scattered across the highway. You hear me?"

I looked at him. My best friend since elementary school, the only person in Oakdale besides Diane who still looked at me like I mattered. "There are worse ways to go."

"No. There aren't." Tommy stepped back from my truck. "Whatever you're trying to prove, it's not worth dying for."

He walked away, and I sat there alone with my hollow victory and the knowledge that he was right. I wasn't trying to prove anything. I was just trying to feel something other than trapped.

Other guys came by to collect winnings or pay up, slapping my shoulder. I nodded, played the part. Easier than admitting the truth.

The truth was I gave too many damns. About Pa, the farm, disappointing everyone, being exactly who they thought I was because I didn't know how to be anyone else.

I drove home slower, windows down, night air cooling my skin. Adrenaline faded, leaving just tired. Tomorrow was Monday. School, suspension over, back to pretending I had a future planned.

The Turner farm was dark except for the porch light Pa always left on. I sat in my truck looking at that light, thinking about Ma and church and Diane's kindness and Tommy's worry and Ray's smugness and Pa's disappointment.

Seventeen years old, drowning in a town where everyone already knew how my story would end. The rebel son who never amounted to anything.

Maybe they were right.

Or maybe I just hadn't figured out how to prove them wrong yet.

I cut the engine and went inside, carrying the weight of my reputation like a coat I couldn't take off.
