# Chapter 6: The Luxury of Not Knowing

Friday evening I found myself at Harper's Diner, telling myself I wasn't there because of Audrey's invitation. Just needed to get out of the house. Away from Pa's silence and the weight of being exactly who everyone expected.

The diner was busy. I slid into a booth near the back, by the window. Alone, same as always.

Five minutes later, Audrey walked in.

She spotted me immediately, walked straight over and slid into the seat across from me without asking.

"Hey," she said.

"Hey."

Diane appeared with coffee and a knowing smile. Flipped over Audrey's cup, poured for both of us.

"Menus?"

"Please," Audrey said.

Diane set them down and disappeared, grinning. By tomorrow, the whole town would know Wade Turner had dinner with the new girl.

"I wasn't sure you'd be here," Audrey said, wrapping her hands around her coffee cup.

"Wasn't sure I would be either."

"But you are."

"Yeah. How's the car?"

"Runs perfectly now. Got the cap replaced."

"Good."

"Everyone's related in this town, aren't they?"

"Pretty much. Small town, old families."

She looked up. "That sounds suffocating."

Most people romanticized small-town life. Audrey cut straight to the truth.

"It can be," I admitted.

"Tell me about it. The real version, not the tourist brochure."

Diane took our orders—burger and fries for me, meatloaf for Audrey—then left.

"What do you want to know?" I asked.

"What matters here? Why does everyone know everything?"

"It's a farming town. Same families, same land for generations. Church, school, town events—that's the structure. Everyone shows up to everything. If you don't, people talk."

"So reputation matters."

"Reputation's everything. Your family name, your parents' standing, what people think of you—it all sticks. And once people decide who you are, it's almost impossible to change their minds."

She nodded, absorbing this. "That's why you said maybe instead of yes when I asked about the diner. You're used to people already having opinions about you."

The observation was too sharp, too accurate. "Something like that."

"What's the opinion?"

"That I'm trouble. The disappointing son, the rebel, the kid wasting his potential." I shrugged like it didn't matter, even though we both knew it did. "Not exactly the kind of guy parents want their daughters talking to."

"Good thing I don't have a mother here to warn me off, then."

"Where's your mother?"

"Atlanta. She stayed to finish her nursing degree. My parents are still together, just separated temporarily while she finishes school." Audrey traced the rim of her coffee cup. "Her family had very specific ideas about who I should be. Debutante, sorority girl, marry the right kind of boy from the right kind of family. I wanted to work with my hands, fix things, understand systems."

"And they didn't like that?"

"My mother called it unladylike. My grandmother said I was throwing away opportunities. But my dad said it was practical and smart." She met my eyes. "When he got this job and said I could come with him if I wanted, I chose to go. My mother's family called it running away, but I called it choosing my own path."

I understood that more than she knew. "How'd that go over?"

"About as well as you'd expect. But I'm here, and they're there, and for the first time in my life, nobody knows who I'm supposed to be."

"The luxury of not knowing," I said.

"Exactly." She smiled. "In Atlanta, I was Audrey Palmer, whose family has been in society since before the war, whose mother chairs three charity committees, whose future was already mapped out before I was born. Here, I'm just the new girl. It's...freeing."

Diane brought our food, set it down with a wink I pretended not to see. Audrey dug into her meatloaf like she hadn't eaten in days.

"This is so much better than gas station sandwiches," she said.

"Yeah, Diane's mom is a good cook."

We ate in comfortable silence for a while. It was strange, sitting across from someone who didn't have fifteen years of context coloring how they saw me. Someone who hadn't decided I was trouble before I opened my mouth.

"So what's your story?" Audrey asked eventually. "The real one, not the reputation."

"Not much to tell."

"I don't believe that. You rebuilt a truck from scrap. That takes skill and patience and dedication. Those aren't troublemaker qualities."

I picked at my fries, not sure how much to say. "My mom died five years ago. Cancer. After that, my dad retreated into the farm and expectations, and I just... didn't want what he wanted for me. The farm, the family legacy, all of it. We've been fighting about it ever since."

"What do you want instead?"

The question nobody asked. What do you want? Everyone told me what I should want, what I was supposed to want. Nobody asked what I actually did want.

"Honestly? I don't know. I know I want out of Oakdale, but I don't have a plan beyond that. Just... somewhere else. Somewhere I can be someone other than who this town decided I am."

Audrey nodded like that made sense. "You know what's interesting? You say you're running from something, but when you talk about fixing engines, you light up. Like that's the one thing you're running toward."

"I like problems that have solutions. You take it apart, figure out what's broken, fix it, put it back together. It works or it doesn't. No judgment, no expectations, just mechanics."

"Unlike people."

"Yeah. Unlike people."

She ate another bite of meatloaf, considering. "My dad's company works with farmers on agricultural equipment. New technology, sustainable practices, that kind of thing. They're always looking for people who understand both farming and mechanical systems."

"I don't want to farm."

"I didn't say farming. I said agricultural equipment. There's a difference."

There was. I'd never thought about it that way before. "Your dad do that? Equipment instead of farming?"

"Yeah. He grew up on a farm, hated the routine, loved the machinery. Found a way to work with what he liked instead of fighting against it." She looked at me directly. "Sometimes the answer isn't running away from everything. It's figuring out what parts you actually want and finding a different way to approach them."

The observation hit harder than I expected. I'd been so busy fighting against the farm, against Pa's expectations, that I'd never considered there might be middle ground.

"That's pretty smart for someone who just got here," I said.

"I've had practice finding middle ground. When your family wants you to be one thing and you want to be something else, you learn to look for the space between."

"And you found it?"

"I'm sitting in a diner in Oakdale, Georgia instead of at a debutante luncheon in Atlanta, so yeah. I found it."

I smiled despite myself. "How do you like Oakdale so far?"

"It's different. Slower. Everyone stares at the new girl, which is annoying but expected. The school's smaller than my old one. The food options are limited." She grinned. "But I don't have to pretend to be someone I'm not, and there are people here who fix cars in parking lots just to be helpful. So it's got potential."

"Potential. That's everyone's favorite word for me."

"The difference is they see wasted potential. I see untapped potential."

"That the same thing?"

"Not even close. Wasted means you had it and threw it away. Untapped means it's still there, waiting."

I didn't know what to say to that. Nobody had ever described me as untapped potential before. Just wasted. Just disappointing.

We finished eating and Diane brought the check. I reached for it, but Audrey was faster.

"I invited you, remember? As a thank you for fixing my car."

"Electrical tape's not worth a dinner."

"It is to me. My car works because of you." She pulled out cash and set it on the table. "Besides, I wanted to learn about Oakdale. You delivered."

We walked out into the warm June evening. Main Street was quiet—a few cars parked near the drugstore, old Mr. Peterson sweeping the sidewalk in front of the hardware store, a couple of kids riding bikes in the fading light.

"Want to see the most scenic spot in Oakdale?" I heard myself ask.

"There's a scenic spot?"

"One. And you've probably got about ten minutes before it's just dark."

I drove us in my truck out past the Turner farm, up to the overlook on the hill beyond our property. From here, you could see the whole valley—cotton fields stretching to the horizon, the town clustered in the distance, the last light painting everything gold.

We got out and sat on the tailgate, legs dangling, watching the sun sink lower.

"Okay," Audrey said. "This is beautiful."

"Yeah."

"But you hate it."

I glanced at her, surprised. "What makes you say that?"

"The way you're looking at it. Like it's a cage instead of a home."

Too perceptive. "It's both, I guess. Beautiful and suffocating at the same time."

"I get that," she said quietly. "Atlanta was beautiful too. Historic homes, magnolia trees, southern charm. But all I could see were the walls of expectation closing in."

We sat in silence, watching the valley darken. And for the first time in years, sitting next to someone who understood what it was like to feel trapped by beauty, I didn't feel quite so alone.

"Thanks for showing me this," Audrey said eventually.

"Thanks for not knowing my reputation."

She smiled. "The luxury of being new."

"Yeah." But I wondered how long that luxury would last. How long before someone warned her off, before she heard all the stories and decided I was exactly what everyone said I was.

I drove her back to town, pulled up in front of the address she gave me. A small house on the decent side of town, lights on in the windows.

"See you Monday?" she asked.

"Yeah. See you Monday."

She got out, then leaned back in the window. "Wade? For what it's worth, I don't think you're wasted potential. I think you're just figuring out what you want to be tapped for."

She walked to her door, and I sat there a minute before driving off, her words circling in my head.

Untapped potential. A different way to look at the same problem.

Maybe she was right. Maybe the answer wasn't escaping everything, but finding what was worth staying for.
