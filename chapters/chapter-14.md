# Chapter 14: The Difficult Conversation

Audrey had been pushing me all week. "You need to actually talk to your dad. Not hint, not discuss irrigation systems. Really talk. Tell him what you're thinking, what you want, what you're scared of."

"He knows."

"Does he? Or does he just know you're researching and thinking? There's a difference between knowing someone's considering something and hearing them say it out loud."

She was right. She usually was. But the thought of sitting down with Pa and having that conversation—vulnerable and honest and real—terrified me.

Saturday evening, I found him in the barn. Working late, same as always, fixing a cultivator that'd broken during the week. The summer sun was setting, throwing long shadows across the barn floor, and dust motes floated in the shafts of golden light. I'd been avoiding this all day, finding excuses, delaying. Cleaned my truck, organized my tools, fixed a hinge on the machinery shed door—anything to put off this conversation. But it was time.

"Pa?"

He looked up from the cultivator, grease on his hands, the late light making him look older and somehow more human than the distant figure I'd been fighting against for five years. "Yeah?"

"Can we talk? Really talk, I mean. Not about chores or schedules. About... everything."

Something in my voice must've tipped him off that this was serious—more serious than asking permission to use the truck or explaining why I was late for dinner. He set down his wrench carefully, wiped his hands on a rag, and gave me his full attention. "Sure. I'm listening."

I sat on the workbench across from him, suddenly unsure how to start this conversation I'd been rehearsing in my head all day. How did you tell your father that you'd spent five years fighting him but now wanted to work with him? That you were scared of disappointing him but also scared of succeeding? That you didn't know if you were strong enough to be the son he wanted but you were willing to try? Where did you even begin to bridge five years of anger and misunderstanding?

"I've been doing a lot of thinking," I started, the words coming out rougher than I'd planned. "About the farm. About my future. About what I actually want instead of just what I don't want."

Pa nodded, waiting.

"For a long time, I thought I had to choose between being your son and being myself. Like I couldn't honor our family's legacy and still make my own choices. So I chose myself, and that meant fighting you about everything."

"I know."

"But I was wrong." The admission felt like pulling a splinter. "It wasn't an either-or. I just couldn't see the middle ground because I was too angry to look for it."

Pa was quiet for a long moment. Then he said, "I was wrong too."

I looked up, surprised.

"I tried to force you into a mold," he continued. "The same one I fit, the same one my father fit. And when you didn't fit it naturally, I pushed harder instead of stepping back and asking what mold you did fit." He rubbed his face, looking older than I'd ever seen him. "Your mother used to tell me that. Said I was trying to make you into me instead of helping you become you. I didn't listen."

The mention of Ma hit like a punch to the chest. "She said that?"

"All the time. Especially after you started pulling away. She said you weren't rejecting the farm, you were rejecting my way of seeing it. That if I'd just give you room to approach it differently, you might find your own relationship with the land." He met my eyes. "She was right. I just didn't want to admit it because that meant admitting I'd been wrong."

We sat there in the barn, years of misunderstanding between us, and I felt something shift. Not fixed—we weren't magically healed. But... lighter. Like a door opening.

"I want to stay," I said. "Work the farm. But differently. Innovation with tradition. Modern techniques that still honor what you and Grandpa and Great-Grandpa built."

"I know. I've seen what you've been researching."

"And you're okay with it?"

"Wade." Pa set down his tools and turned to face me fully. "I've spent five years watching you pull away, watching you hurt, not knowing how to reach you. If you want to stay and work this farm, even if it's not the way I'd do it, that's more than I hoped for. That's..." His voice caught. "That's an answer to prayers I stopped saying because I thought they were useless."

My own throat went tight. "I'm scared I'll mess it up."

"You will. Mess some of it up, I mean. That's how you learn. I messed up plenty when I took over from my father. Innovation always comes with risk."

"What if I can't make it work? What if the changes don't pay off, or I ruin what took three generations to build?"

"Then we'll figure it out together. But Wade, you're smart. You think about systems and problems in ways I never did. If anyone can bridge old and new, it's you."

The trust in his voice was almost harder to bear than his disappointment had been.

"I want to take Mr. Palmer up on his offer," I said. "Shadow him, learn the business side of agricultural equipment. Maybe take some classes at the junior college in agronomy or agricultural business. Build the knowledge I need to do this right."

"Makes sense."

"And then come back here. Start implementing changes small-scale, prove they work before going bigger."

"Sounds like a solid plan."

"You're really okay with this?"

Pa was quiet for a moment. Then he said, "After your mother died, I didn't know how to talk to you. You were twelve and angry and hurting, and I was drowning in grief and work. So I just... pushed. Thought if I could make you care about the farm the way I did, it would give you purpose, direction. Something to hold onto."

"It just made me feel trapped."

"I know. I see that now. But Wade, what I wanted—what I still want—is for you to have a good life. A meaningful life. If that's here on this farm, using your brain and your skills to innovate and improve, then that's better than I ever hoped. If it'd been somewhere else, I'd have accepted that too. Eventually."

"Really?"

"Really. You're my son. I want you to be happy more than I want you to be a farmer." He picked up his wrench again, turned it over in his work-worn hands. "Though I admit, having both is pretty damn satisfying."

I laughed, surprised. Pa almost never swore.

"So we're doing this?" I asked. "Working together instead of against each other?"

"If you're willing to put up with an old man's stubbornness when you want to try something I think won't work."

"If you're willing to put up with a kid's stubbornness when I insist on trying it anyway."

"Deal." He held out his hand.

I shook it, and the gesture felt like more than an agreement. It felt like a new beginning.

We worked on the cultivator together for another hour, and for the first time in five years, working side by side didn't feel like obligation or punishment. It felt like partnership.

When we finished and headed up to the house, Pa said, "Your mother would be proud of you. Of who you're becoming."

The words hit me square in the chest, knocked the breath out of me.

"She always said you had your own path to walk," Pa continued. "That my job wasn't to pave it for you but to make sure you had good boots for the journey." He looked at the fields stretching out around us. "I forgot that for a while. Got so focused on where I thought you should go that I didn't pay attention to where you were actually headed."

"I didn't know where I was headed."

"You do now, though. Don't you?"

I thought about it. The research I'd been doing, the conversations with Mr. Palmer, the plans forming in my head for how to modernize the Turner farm while keeping what made it ours.

"Yeah," I said. "I do."

"Good." Pa clapped my shoulder, and the gesture was brief but solid. Fatherly in a way I'd almost forgotten. "Then let's get you there."

Inside, I called Audrey.

"How'd it go?" she asked.

"Good. Really good, actually."

"See? I told you honest conversation works better than fighting."

"Don't gloat."

"I'm not gloating. I'm basking in being right." I could hear the smile in her voice. "Seriously though, I'm proud of you. That took courage."

"Thanks for pushing me."

"That's what friends are for."

I hung up and sat on my bed, looking around my room. Same room I'd grown up in, same ceiling I'd stared at during countless sleepless nights. But it felt different now. Not a cage. Just a room in a house on a farm I was choosing to call home.

That night, I slept better than I had in years.
