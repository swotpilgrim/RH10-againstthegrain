# Chapter 14: The Difficult Conversation

Audrey had been pushing me all week. "You need to actually talk to your dad. Not hint around, not just show interest in farming stuff. Really talk. Tell him what you're thinking, what you want, what you're researching."

"He knows I've been researching."

"Does he? Or does he just notice you reading farming journals and assume it's another phase?" She leaned against her car in the school parking lot, arms crossed. "There's a difference between him observing you and you actually communicating with him."

"Every conversation we have ends badly."

"Because you're both performing. You're being the rebel, he's being the disappointed father. But what if you dropped that? What if you just told him the truth—that you're interested in sustainable farming, that you've been researching innovations, that you want to figure out how to honor tradition while implementing change?"

"And what if he shuts me down? What if I try to be vulnerable and he just sees it as another excuse, another way I'm trying to avoid 'real work'?"

"Then at least you'll know. At least you'll have tried." She looked at me directly. "Wade, how is your father supposed to know what you actually want if you never tell him? All he sees is you resisting. He doesn't know you're engaging with farming differently because you haven't told him."

"He won't listen."

"Have you given him a chance to? A real chance, where you're honest about what you're thinking instead of just defensive?"

I wanted to argue, but she had a point. Pa and I had been fighting the same fight for five years. We'd perfected our roles—him disappointed, me rebellious. But I'd never actually tried to break that pattern, never risked real honesty.

"What if I try and it doesn't work?" I asked quietly.

"Then it doesn't work. But you'll know you tried. And that's better than always wondering what if."

The conversation stuck with me all week. Every time I saw Pa, I thought about saying something. But the words wouldn't come. How did you start a conversation like that? How did you drop five years of defensive armor and just... talk?

Saturday evening, I found him in the barn. He was working late, fixing a cultivator that'd broken during the week. The summer sun was setting, throwing long shadows across the barn floor, and dust motes floated in the shafts of golden light.

I'd been avoiding this all day. Found a dozen excuses—cleaned my truck, organized my tools, fixed a hinge on the machinery shed door. Anything to delay this conversation.

But it was time.

"Pa?"

He looked up from the cultivator, grease on his hands. "Yeah?"

"Can we talk? Really talk, I mean."

Something in my voice must've registered because he set down his wrench and gave me his attention. "I'm listening."

I sat on the workbench across from him, trying to figure out how to start. My carefully rehearsed words evaporated.

"I've been doing a lot of research," I finally said. "About farming. Sustainable practices, water conservation, modern techniques that could improve efficiency while still honoring what you and Grandpa built."

Pa nodded, waiting.

"There are these new irrigation systems—pivot systems—that could save us thirty percent on water costs. And crop rotation methods that improve soil quality while maintaining yield. Techniques for—"

"Wade." Pa held up his hand, and I stopped. "What's this really about?"

"I'm trying to tell you. I've been researching farming innovations, ways to modernize the farm while still respecting the legacy you and—"

"You've always got some new idea," Pa cut me off, his voice tired. "Some new system, some new way that's supposedly better than what's worked for three generations. It's always something, isn't it?"

The dismissal in his tone stung. "No, that's not what I'm saying. If you'd just listen—"

"I am listening. I'm listening to you tell me that you've been reading some library books and now you think you know better than me and your grandfather about how to run this farm." He picked up a rag, wiped his hands. "You're always thinking you're smarter than everyone else, Wade. Always looking for some shortcut, some easier way."

"It's not about shortcuts!" The frustration burst out. "I'm trying to show you that I'm actually interested in farming, that I've been thinking about how to make it work, how to—"

"How to avoid real work while pretending you're doing something important?" Pa's voice was flat. "Because that's what this sounds like to me. You've spent five years fighting against this farm, and now you've read a few articles and suddenly you want me to believe you care?"

"I do care! That's what I'm trying to tell you—"

"What you're doing is what you always do. Finding some new angle to prove you're too good for the way we do things. Your grandfather farmed this land for forty years using methods that worked. I've been farming it for thirty using methods that worked. But you—you've been reading about farming for what, a few weeks?—and you think you know better."

I tried to keep my voice level. "I'm not saying I know better. I'm saying there are new techniques, proven techniques, that could help us be more efficient, more sustainable—"

"Sustainable." Pa shook his head. "That's a word city people use when they don't understand real farming. This land has sustained us for three generations, Wade. We don't need fancy new systems to tell us how to take care of it."

"That's not what sustainable means. It means conservation, soil health, water management—"

"I know what it means." Pa turned back to the cultivator, a clear dismissal. "And I know what you're doing. This is just another way to avoid committing to actual farm work. Another excuse."

The words hit like a physical blow. "An excuse? I'm trying to tell you that I want to stay, that I've been figuring out how I could work this farm in a way that makes sense to me—"

"By reading books instead of getting your hands dirty? By thinking about farming instead of actually doing it?" He didn't even look at me. "When you're ready to actually work this farm the right way, you know where to find me."

"The right way meaning your way."

"Meaning the way that's worked for seventy years. Meaning the way that put food on our table and kept this land in the family." Now he did look at me, and his expression was tired. Disappointed. "You want to play farmer, read all the journals you want. But don't come to me with your theories and expect me to upend three generations of knowledge because you've got some new idea."

I stood up, my hands clenched into fists. Five years of fighting, and this time I'd actually tried. I'd dropped the defensive act, tried to communicate honestly about what I was thinking and researching. And he'd shut me down before I could even really explain.

"I wasn't asking you to upend anything," I said, my voice rough. "I was trying to show you that I'm actually engaging with this, that I've been thinking about the farm and my future and how I might fit here. But you're not even listening."

"I'm listening to what you're doing, not what you're saying. And what you're doing is the same thing you've always done—looking for ways to prove you're smarter than me instead of just working alongside me."

"That's not—" I stopped. What was the point? He'd already decided what this conversation meant, already fit it into the same pattern we'd been stuck in for five years. "You're right. We're done here."

I walked out of the barn before he could respond, before he could see how much it hurt to try and be honest and have him throw it back in my face.

The evening air was thick and hot. I climbed into my truck and just sat there, gripping the steering wheel, trying to breathe through the anger and the hurt and the crushing disappointment.

I'd done exactly what Audrey suggested. Tried to really communicate, tried to show Pa that I was engaging with farming on my own terms. And he'd dismissed it as another excuse, another way I was trying to avoid "real work."

Maybe he was right. Maybe all the research was just performance, just me playing at caring without actually committing. Maybe I was exactly what he thought I was—a kid with ideas but no follow-through.

I started the engine and drove. No destination, just away. Away from the barn and Pa's dismissal and the realization that even when I tried to do things right, it wasn't enough.

The back roads were empty. I pushed the speedometer higher than I should, the truck responding with familiar power. This was what I knew. Speed, motion, the ability to outrun everything that hurt.

Caring had gotten me nowhere. Trying had gotten me shut down. Maybe the rebel act wasn't performance. Maybe it was just who I was, and trying to be anything else was the real lie.

I drove for an hour, maybe more. Let the anger burn itself out into something duller, more familiar. Disappointment. Not in Pa this time—in myself. For thinking it would be different. For hoping that one honest conversation could bridge five years of mutual misunderstanding.

By the time I got home, full dark had fallen. The barn light was off—Pa had finished his work and gone inside. I went straight to my room, shut the door, and lay on my bed staring at the ceiling.

The ceiling paint was still peeling in the same corner it'd been peeling since I was ten. Some things never changed.

I'd tried. Really tried. Risked being vulnerable, risked honest communication. And it hadn't mattered.

That hurt worse than five years of fighting ever had.
