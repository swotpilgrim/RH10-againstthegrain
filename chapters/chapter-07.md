# Chapter 7: The Tour Guide

Over the next week, I found myself showing Audrey around Oakdale without quite knowing how it happened. It started Monday when she asked where the library was—a small brick building next to the post office with maybe three thousand books total. Tuesday, she wanted to know about the creek where people went swimming. By Wednesday, I was driving her around town pointing out landmarks like I'd lived here all my life.

Which I had. That was the problem. Every street, every building, every corner held fifteen years of history. The pharmacy where Ma used to get her medicine. The park where I'd skinned my knee at seven. The high school where I'd spent twelve years feeling like the walls were closing in.

But showing it to Audrey felt different. Through her eyes, Oakdale wasn't a cage. It was just a place, with history and quirks and rhythms of its own.

"So that's where farmers meet on Saturday mornings," I said, pulling up to the courthouse square. Old men sat on benches, talking about weather and crop yields, same conversations they'd been having for thirty years. "They've been doing that since before I was born."

"Why?" Audrey asked, genuinely curious.

"Tradition, I guess. Social structure. Everyone knows everyone, so you show up and talk because that's what you do."

"Do you go?"

"Used to, with my dad when I was a kid. Haven't in years."

She nodded, taking in the scene. "What else?"

I drove her to the swimming creek where Tommy and I had spent every summer since we were ten, the old rope swing still hanging from the massive oak tree. The drag strip—empty in daylight, just cracked asphalt and dust and memories of Saturday nights. The back roads where kids drove too fast on Friday nights, testing their trucks and their courage in equal measure. Places that mattered in a town where not much happened, where you made your own entertainment or died of boredom.

"Why do people stay?" she asked as we sat on my tailgate at the overlook Thursday afternoon. "I mean, what keeps them here generation after generation?"

I'd been asking myself that question for years. "Family land. Family legacy. The feeling that you're part of something bigger than yourself, I guess." I picked at a rust spot on the tailgate. "My dad loves this land. Really loves it. Talks about it like it's alive, like it matters beyond just making a living."

"But you don't feel that way."

"I've tried. Wanted to, for a long time. But every time I look at these fields, all I see is being stuck."

"What if you're not stuck? What if leaving just means running?"

"There a difference?"

"Yeah." She turned to face me. "Stuck means you can't move. Running means you won't stay still. One's about powerlessness, the other's about fear."

The observation stung because it was probably true. "So which am I?"

"I don't know. Which are you?"

Before I could answer, Tommy's truck pulled up. He climbed out, waved, headed over.

"Hey, man. Diane said you were out here." He nodded to Audrey. "Hey, Audrey."

"Hi, Tommy."

"Some of us are heading to the strip tonight. You racing?" Tommy asked me.

"Maybe."

"Bring Audrey. Let her see what passes for entertainment around here."

Audrey looked interested. "What's the strip?"

"Drag racing," I said. "Unofficial, probably technically illegal, definitely dangerous."

"Sounds perfect," she said, and I couldn't tell if she was serious or sarcastic.

That night, I picked her up and drove to the strip. Cars were already gathering—guys I'd known since elementary school, a few from neighboring towns, all of them there for the same reason. Speed, competition, the rush of pushing engines to their limit.

"This is the strip?" Audrey asked, looking at the abandoned stretch of highway.

"Yeah. Not much to look at in daylight, but at night with the headlights and the noise, it's different."

"Show me."

I introduced her around—Tommy, Jake, a few others. Ray Coleman was there too, leaning against his truck with his buddies. He smirked when he saw Audrey with me.

"Turner's bringing dates now?" Ray called out. "That's new."

"Shut up, Ray," Tommy said before I could respond.

"What? I'm just saying, the new girl doesn't know what she's getting into." Ray walked closer. "You know who he is, sweetheart? Wade Turner, the rebel son. Fights, races, disappoints his daddy every chance he gets."

"I know who he is," Audrey said calmly. "He's the guy who fixed my car."

"For now. But once you see the real him—"

"I can see him just fine." She didn't raise her voice, didn't get defensive. Just stated it like a fact.

Ray looked like he wanted to say more, but something in Audrey's expression made him back off. He walked away, muttering to his friends.

"You didn't have to do that," I told her.

"Do what? Tell the truth?" She watched Ray retreat. "He's one of those guys who needs everyone else to fail so he can feel successful, isn't he?"

"Something like that."

"I grew up with guys like him in Atlanta. They're all the same—insecure and mean about it."

The races started. I won my first match, lost the second to Jake by half a length. Audrey watched from my tailgate, completely absorbed. When I pulled back after the second race, she was grinning.

"That was incredible," she said. "Your truck is fast."

"Built it to be."

"Can I try?"

I blinked. "Try what?"

"Driving. Racing. Whatever you call it."

"You want to race?"

"Not race-race. But drive. See what it feels like."

Nobody let girls drive at the strip. It just wasn't done. But Audrey was looking at me with those steady gray eyes, and I heard myself saying, "Okay."

I drove us out to the empty back road past the Turner farm. Pulled over, switched seats.

"It's a manual," I warned.

"I know how to drive a manual. My dad taught me on his old truck."

Of course he did.

I walked her through the basics—clutch, gas, brake, where the sweet spot was. Then I let her drive.

She was cautious at first, feeling out the engine, getting used to how the truck responded. Then gradually, she picked up speed. Forty, fifty, sixty. The road stretched empty ahead, and Audrey leaned into it, confidence building.

"Faster?" she asked.

"If you want."

She pushed it to seventy, and I watched her grin get wider. The wind through the windows, the engine roaring, the freedom of empty road and speed—she got it. Understood what I felt when I drove like this.

"This is amazing!" she shouted over the noise.

"Yeah!"

She drove for another few miles, then gradually slowed, pulled over, cut the engine. Sat there breathing hard, exhilarated.

"I get it now," she said. "Why you do this. It's not about running away. It's about feeling free."

"Something like that."

"Everything else has rules and expectations and judgments. But out here, it's just you and the road and what you can do."

Exactly. She understood in five minutes what most people never got.

We switched seats and I drove back toward town. The night was warm, stars out, the kind of June evening that made you forget winter ever happened.

"Can I ask you something?" Audrey said.

"Yeah."

"When you talk about leaving Oakdale, where do you imagine going?"

"I don't know. Anywhere. Everywhere."

"That's not a place. That's an escape."

"What's wrong with escape?"

"Nothing, if you know what you're escaping from and what you're escaping to. But if it's just away..." She trailed off.

"Just away what?"

"You take yourself with you. Whatever you're running from that's inside you, it goes too."

I'd never thought about it that way. "So what, I'm supposed to just stay here and accept it?"

"No. But maybe figure out what part's the cage and what part's just you being scared."

"I'm not scared."

"Sure you're not."

We drove in silence for a while. Finally, I asked, "When you left Atlanta, was that running or leaving?"

"Leaving. I knew what I was leaving—my mother's expectations—and what I was going toward—the chance to figure out who I am without all that weight. It was a choice, not a flight."

"And you don't regret it?"

"Not yet. Ask me again in six months."

I pulled up to her house. The porch light was on, warm and welcoming.

"Thanks for tonight," she said. "For showing me your world."

"Thanks for not judging it."

"Why would I judge it? It's honest. More honest than debutante balls and charity galas where everyone's performing for each other."

She got out, then leaned back in. "Wade? You asked me why people stay. Maybe the better question is what makes leaving worth it. Because leaving for nothing is just running."

She walked to her door and I sat there, her words circling like they always did. What makes leaving worth it.

I didn't have an answer. Not yet.

But for the first time, I was starting to think maybe I needed one before I went.
