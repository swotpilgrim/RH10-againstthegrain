# Chapter 15: Admitting What Matters

The afternoon after my conversation with Pa, Audrey found me at the creek. I was sitting on the bank, throwing rocks into the water harder than necessary, my mind still spinning from everything that had happened, everything I'd said, everything Pa had said back.

She didn't say anything at first. Just sat down beside me and waited, patient as always.

Finally, I threw one more rock and watched it skip twice before sinking.

"I talked to him," I said.

"I know. He called my dad. Mentioned that you two had a good conversation."

That surprised me. "He did?"

"Yeah. Said he was proud of you. That it took real courage to be that honest."

The words hit me different than I expected. Not the approval I'd been chasing—something deeper. Recognition. Respect.

"I don't feel courageous," I admitted. "I feel scared out of my mind."

"Of what?"

I picked up another rock, turned it over in my hand. Smooth from years in the creek, worn down by water and time. "Of caring. Of admitting that this matters to me. The farm, my dad's opinion, making this work. For five years I've been pretending not to care because not caring felt safe. Can't be disappointed if you don't have expectations, right?"

"But you do care."

"Yeah." The admission felt like ripping off a bandage. "I care so much it terrifies me. I care what my dad thinks. I care about the farm and the legacy and proving I can do this differently while still honoring what came before. I care about not failing, about not letting him down again, about actually being the son he—"

My voice broke. I stopped, threw the rock harder than intended. It hit the water with a splash that sent ripples spreading outward.

Audrey didn't say anything. Just waited.

"When Ma died," I finally continued, voice rough, "I felt like I lost the only person who believed in me no matter what. Pa was so buried in grief and work, and I was just this angry kid who couldn't do anything right. For five years I've been fighting to not care because caring meant being vulnerable to that kind of loss again."

"But you can't not care. It's not who you are."

"I know." I laughed, bitter. "That's the problem. I've been pretending to be this rebel who doesn't give a damn, but the truth is I give too many damns. About Pa, about the farm, about proving myself. And that makes me vulnerable. Makes it possible to fail in ways that actually hurt."

"That's what growing up is, Wade. Letting yourself care even when it's scary. Choosing to be vulnerable because the alternative is not really living."

I looked at her. "When'd you get so wise?"

"Practice. Lots of painful practice." She picked up her own rock. "You know what I think?"

"What?"

"I think caring isn't weakness. Not caring is easy—anyone can do that. Fighting is easy. But actually wanting something and risking failure? Actually admitting you care about your father's opinion and your family's legacy and making a future that honors both who you are and where you come from? That takes real courage."

"Doesn't feel courageous. Feels terrifying."

"Same thing, usually." She threw her rock. It skipped three times. "The things worth doing are scary. If they weren't, everyone would do them."

We sat in silence, the creek flowing past, carrying water that had been flowing past this same spot for a hundred years, would keep flowing for a hundred more. Constant motion, constant change, but the creek remained.

"I'm at the point of no return, aren't I?" I said. "I've admitted I want this. Told my dad I'm staying. Started making plans. I can't go back to safe rebellion now."

"Do you want to go back?"

I thought about it honestly. A month ago, two months ago, I'd have said yes in a heartbeat. The rebel role was comfortable, familiar. I knew how to be the disappointment, knew how to not try so I couldn't fail.

But now?

"No," I admitted. "I don't want to go back. I want to move forward. I want to figure out who I actually am instead of who I've been pretending to be. I want to honor my family while still choosing my own path. I want..." I swallowed hard. "I want my father to be proud of me. Not because I became exactly what he wanted, but because I found a way to be myself while still valuing what he taught me."

"That's the first time you've said that out loud."

"I know."

"How does it feel?"

"Terrifying. Honest. Like stepping off a cliff and hoping I can fly."

Audrey smiled. "You can. You've been flying for weeks now, you just didn't realize it because you were so focused on the falling."

Maybe she was right. All the research I'd been doing, the conversations with Mr. Palmer, the honest talks with Pa—maybe that was flying. Maybe choosing and trying and caring was what courage looked like, even when it felt like falling.

"This is the midpoint, isn't it?" I said. "Not of summer, but of... everything. Of figuring out who I am. I can't go back to not caring now. I'm in too deep."

"Is that bad?"

"I don't know. Feels like standing on the edge of something huge. Like everything changes from here."

"Everything already changed. You just admitted it to yourself."

We sat there throwing rocks, and I let myself feel everything I'd been running from. The fear of disappointing Pa. The hope that maybe I could do this. The desperate want to prove myself. The vulnerability of caring when caring meant risking everything.

It hurt. But it also felt real in a way nothing had felt in five years.

"Can I tell you something?" I asked.

"Always."

"I'm not doing this for you. The changes, the research, staying on the farm. I thought maybe I was, at first. But I'm not. I'm doing it for me."

"I know."

"You do?"

"Wade." She turned to face me full-on. "If you were doing this for me, you'd be resentful. You'd be performing instead of genuinely engaging. But when you talk about irrigation systems or sustainable farming or your plans for the Turner farm, you light up. That's not performance. That's passion."

"I didn't know I could be passionate about farming."

"You're not passionate about farming the way your dad does it. You're passionate about problem-solving, about innovation, about finding better ways. Farming just happens to be the canvas you're working on."

That felt true. Truer than anything I'd admitted to myself.

"So this is it," I said. "The point where I stop running and start building."

"If you want it to be."

"I do. I'm scared, but I do."

"Then that's all that matters." She stood up, offered me her hand. "Come on."

"Where are we going?"

"Back to the farm. You've got work to do, plans to make, a future to build. And I want to see you do it."

I took her hand and let her pull me up. We walked back through the Georgia afternoon, the July heat making everything shimmer, and I thought about what came next.

The research. The apprenticeship with Mr. Palmer. The slow, careful implementation of new systems on the Turner farm. The inevitable setbacks and challenges. The possibility of failure.

But also the possibility of success. Of proving to myself and Pa and the whole damn town that I could honor tradition while choosing innovation. That I could be both my father's son and my own man.

That scared me more than anything—the hope. The wanting. The caring.

But Audrey was right. Not caring was easy. Caring took courage.

And for the first time in five years, I was ready to be courageous.

That night, lying in bed, I thought about Ma. What would she think of all this? Of me finally choosing instead of just rejecting, engaging instead of just rebelling?

I thought she'd be proud. Not because I was becoming exactly what anyone wanted, but because I was figuring out what I wanted and choosing it even when it scared me.

Audrey had said once that my mom would be proud of me for being honest. I hadn't believed her then.

But maybe I was starting to now.

I'd admitted what mattered. To Pa, to Audrey, to myself. The farm. The legacy. The relationship with my father that I'd spent five years pretending didn't matter while it tore me apart that it did.

I cared. About all of it. And that made me vulnerable in ways I'd spent half my life trying to avoid.

But it also made me real.

And real, scared, vulnerable, caring—that was better than safe and numb and pretending.

That was living.

Tomorrow I'd wake up and keep building this new life I was choosing. Keep researching, keep planning, keep moving toward a future that honored both who I was and where I came from.

But tonight, I let myself just feel it. The fear and the hope and the terrifying possibility that maybe, just maybe, I could actually do this.

I could be Wade Turner, fourth-generation farmer, innovator, problem-solver, son.

Not despite my rebellion, but because of what I'd learned from it.

And that was worth every scary, vulnerable, courageous step ahead.
