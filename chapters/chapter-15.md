# Chapter 15: Admitting What Matters

The afternoon after my conversation with Pa, Audrey found me at the creek. I was sitting on the bank, throwing rocks into the water harder than necessary, my mind still spinning from everything that had happened, everything I'd said, everything Pa had thrown back at me.

She didn't say anything at first. Just sat down beside me and waited, patient as always.

Finally, I threw one more rock and watched it skip twice before sinking.

"I talked to him," I said.

"I figured. You've got that look."

"What look?"

"Like you tried something that mattered and it didn't work out the way you hoped." She picked up her own rock, turned it over in her hand. "What happened?"

I threw another rock, harder this time. "Exactly what I was afraid would happen. I tried to tell him about the research, about being interested in sustainable farming, about wanting to find a way to work the farm that honors tradition while implementing innovation. And he shut me down. Said I was just looking for shortcuts, trying to prove I'm smarter than him, playing at farming instead of actually committing."

"I'm sorry."

"Don't be. I should've known better." I picked up another rock, felt the weight of it in my palm. "Five years of the same fight, and I thought one conversation would magically fix everything. That was stupid."

"It wasn't stupid to try."

"Feels stupid. Feels like I exposed myself for nothing."

Audrey was quiet for a moment. Then she said, "If it didn't matter to you—what your dad thinks, whether he listens—you wouldn't be sitting here throwing rocks like you're trying to hurt them. So what's really bothering you?"

The question cut too close. I threw another rock, watched it disappear into the creek with a splash.

"Wade."

"What?"

"Talk to me. Really talk, not the defensive version."

I stopped, rock in hand, and just sat there. The creek flowed past, constant and indifferent. The July heat made everything shimmer. And I felt the truth pressing against my chest like I'd been holding my breath for too long.

"I care," I finally said, the words rough. "That's what bothers me. I care what he thinks. I care about the farm and the legacy and proving I can do this. And I hate that I care because caring makes me vulnerable to exactly this kind of hurt."

"Vulnerable how?"

"If I didn't care what my dad thought, his disappointment would be meaningless. Just noise. But I do care, and that means he can hurt me. That means when I try to be honest and he shuts me down, it actually matters." I threw the rock, watched it skip once before sinking. "For five years I've been pretending not to care because not caring felt safe. Can't be disappointed if you don't have expectations, right?"

"But you do have expectations."

"Yeah." The admission felt like ripping off a bandage. "I care so much it terrifies me. I care what my dad thinks. I care about the farm and the legacy and proving I can do this differently while still honoring what came before. I care about not failing, about not letting him down again, about actually being the son he—"

My voice broke. I stopped, threw another rock harder than I meant. It hit the water with a splash that sent ripples spreading outward.

Audrey didn't say anything. Just waited.

"When Ma died," I finally continued, voice rough, "I felt like I lost the only person who believed in me no matter what. Pa was so buried in grief and work, and I was just this angry kid who couldn't do anything right. For five years I've been fighting to not care because caring meant being vulnerable to that kind of loss again, that kind of disappointment."

"But you can't not care. It's not who you are."

"I know." I laughed, bitter. "That's the problem. I've been pretending to be this rebel who doesn't give a damn, but the truth is I give too many damns. About Pa, about the farm, about proving myself. And that makes me vulnerable. Makes it possible to fail in ways that actually hurt."

"That's what growing up is, Wade. Letting yourself care even when it's scary. Choosing to be vulnerable because the alternative is not really living."

I looked at her. "When'd you get so wise?"

"Practice. Lots of painful practice." She picked up her own rock. "You know what I think?"

"What?"

"I think caring isn't weakness. Not caring is easy—anyone can do that. Fighting is easy. But actually wanting something and risking failure? Actually admitting you care about your father's opinion and your family's legacy and making a future that honors both who you are and where you come from? That takes real courage."

"Doesn't feel courageous. Feels terrifying."

"Same thing, usually." She threw her rock. It skipped three times. "The things worth doing are scary. If they weren't, everyone would do them."

We sat in silence, the creek flowing past, carrying water that had been flowing past this same spot for a hundred years, would keep flowing for a hundred more. Constant motion, constant change, but the creek remained.

"I'm at the point of no return, aren't I?" I said. "I've admitted I care. Started researching, started planning, started hoping. Even though my dad rejected my first attempt, I can't go back to safe rebellion now. I'm in too deep."

"Do you want to go back?"

I thought about it honestly. A month ago, two months ago, I'd have said yes in a heartbeat. The rebel role was comfortable, familiar. I knew how to be the disappointment, knew how to not try so I couldn't fail.

But now?

"No," I admitted. "I don't want to go back. I want to move forward. I want to figure out who I actually am instead of who I've been pretending to be. I want to honor my family while still choosing my own path. I want..." I swallowed hard. "I want my father to be proud of me. Not because I became exactly what he wanted, but because I found a way to be myself while still valuing what he taught me."

"That's the first time you've said that out loud."

"I know."

"How does it feel?"

"Terrifying. Honest. Like stepping off a cliff and hoping I can fly."

Audrey smiled. "You can. You've been flying for weeks now, you just didn't realize it because you were so focused on the falling."

Maybe she was right. All the research I'd been doing, the conversations with Mr. Palmer, the honest attempt at talking to Pa even though it failed—maybe that was flying. Maybe choosing and trying and caring was what courage looked like, even when it felt like falling.

"This is the midpoint, isn't it?" I said. "Not of summer, but of... everything. Of figuring out who I am. I've admitted I care, admitted I want this. Can't go back to not caring now. I'm in too deep."

"Is that bad?"

"I don't know. Feels like standing on the edge of something huge. Like everything changes from here."

"Everything already changed. You just admitted it to yourself."

We sat there throwing rocks, and I let myself feel everything I'd been running from. The fear of disappointing Pa. The hope that maybe I could do this anyway. The desperate want to prove myself. The vulnerability of caring when caring meant risking everything, even rejection.

It hurt. But it also felt real in a way nothing had felt in five years.

"Can I tell you something?" I asked.

"Always."

"I'm not doing this for you. The changes, the research, wanting to stay on the farm. I thought maybe I was, at first. But I'm not. I'm doing it for me."

"I know."

"You do?"

"Wade." She turned to face me full-on. "If you were doing this for me, you'd be resentful. You'd be performing instead of genuinely engaging. But when you talk about irrigation systems or sustainable farming or your plans for the Turner farm, you light up. That's not performance. That's passion."

"I didn't know I could be passionate about farming."

"You're not passionate about farming the way your dad does it. You're passionate about problem-solving, about innovation, about finding better ways. Farming just happens to be the canvas you're working on."

That felt true. Truer than anything I'd admitted to myself.

"So this is it," I said. "The point where I stop running and start building. Even if my dad doesn't believe in it yet."

"If you want it to be."

"I do. I'm scared, but I do."

"Then that's all that matters." She stood up, offered me her hand. "Come on."

"Where are we going?"

"Back to reality. You've got work to do, plans to make, a future to build. And the fact that your dad rejected your first attempt doesn't change any of that."

I took her hand and let her pull me up. We walked back through the Georgia afternoon, the July heat making everything shimmer, and I thought about what came next.

The research. The apprenticeship with Mr. Palmer. The slow, careful implementation of new systems on the Turner farm. The inevitable setbacks and challenges. The possibility of failure.

But also the possibility of success. Of proving to myself and Pa and the whole damn town that I could honor tradition while choosing innovation. That I could be both my father's son and my own man.

That scared me more than anything—the hope. The wanting. The caring.

But Audrey was right. Not caring was easy. Caring took courage.

And for the first time in five years, I was ready to be courageous.

That night, lying in bed, I thought about Ma. What would she think of all this? Of me finally choosing instead of just rejecting, engaging instead of just rebelling?

I thought she'd be proud. Not because I was becoming exactly what anyone wanted, but because I was figuring out what I wanted and choosing it even when it scared me, even when the first attempt had failed.

Audrey had said once that my mom would be proud of me for being honest. I hadn't believed her then.

But maybe I was starting to now.

I'd admitted what mattered. To Audrey, to myself. The farm. The legacy. The relationship with my father that I'd spent five years pretending didn't matter while it tore me apart that it did.

I cared. About all of it. And that made me vulnerable in ways I'd spent half my life trying to avoid.

But it also made me real.

And real, scared, vulnerable, caring—that was better than safe and numb and pretending.

That was living.

Tomorrow I'd wake up and keep building this new life I was choosing. Keep researching, keep planning, keep moving toward a future that honored both who I was and where I came from.

But tonight, I let myself just feel it. The fear and the hope and the terrifying possibility that maybe, just maybe, I could actually do this.

I could be Wade Turner, fourth-generation farmer, innovator, problem-solver, son.

Not despite my rejection, but because of what I'd learned from it.

And that was worth every scary, vulnerable, courageous step ahead.
