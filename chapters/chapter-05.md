# Chapter 5: The Engine Whisperer

I approached Audrey's car the way you approach a spooked horse—careful, non-threatening. She had her hands braced on the fender, staring at the engine like if she looked hard enough, the problem would announce itself.

"Car trouble?" I asked.

She straightened up fast, turned to face me. Up close, her eyes were gray—not blue, not green, just clear gray like creek water. And direct. She didn't do that thing most girls did, looking away or acting helpless. Just met my gaze head-on.

"Distributor cap, I think," she said. "It was running rough this morning, and now it won't turn over at all."

I blinked. "You know what a distributor cap is?"

"My dad taught me basic engine maintenance. Says everyone should understand how their vehicle works." She gestured at the Ford. "But understanding and fixing aren't always the same thing."

"No, they're not." I set my bag down and leaned over the engine. "Let me take a look."

She stepped back, giving me room but staying close enough to watch what I was doing. Most girls would've wandered off, pulled out a magazine, called someone to rescue them. This one stayed, paying attention.

I checked the obvious things first. Battery connections—good. Fuel line—no visible issues. Then I pulled the distributor cap and there it was. Hairline crack, barely visible unless you knew what to look for.

"You were right," I said, showing her the cap. "Distributor cap's cracked. See here?" I pointed to the fracture. "That's letting the electrical current leak instead of directing it to the spark plugs."

She leaned in to look, actually studying it. "Can it be fixed?"

"Needs replacing. You got a spare?"

"No. I didn't know I should carry one." She frowned at the cap in my hand. "How much does a new one cost?"

"For this model, maybe ten bucks at Harper's Auto Parts on Main Street. But I can rig something temporary if you've got electrical tape. Get you home, at least."

Her eyebrows went up. "You can do that?"

"Yeah. Hold on."

I jogged to my truck and grabbed the electrical tape from my toolbox. Pa always said you should carry basic supplies—never knew when equipment would break down. I'd hated his lectures about preparation, but right now I was grateful.

I came back and wrapped the cracked distributor cap carefully, sealing the fracture. It wouldn't hold forever—maybe a day or two—but it'd work well enough.

"Why does that fix it?" Audrey asked, watching my hands.

"Distributor cap's job is to keep the electrical current directed to the right spark plugs in the right order. The crack lets current leak out. Tape seals it temporarily, stops the leak." I tightened it back into place. "Try starting it now."

She slid into the driver's seat and turned the key. The engine coughed, hesitated like it was thinking about it, then caught. Not smooth—you could hear the roughness in the idle—but running.

"That's amazing," she said, cutting the engine and getting out. "Thank you." She pulled her wallet from her pocket. "How much do I owe you?"

"Nothing."

"I should pay you something. You fixed my car."

"It's electrical tape and five minutes. Don't worry about it."

She studied me with those gray eyes, like she was trying to solve a puzzle. Made me self-conscious, that look. Like she could see past the leather jacket and the bruised knuckles to something underneath.

"What's your name?" she asked finally.

"Wade. Wade Turner."

"I'm Audrey Palmer." She held out her hand.

I shook it, surprised by the formality. Her grip was firm, no-nonsense. Most girls around here offered limp handshakes, expecting guys to do all the work. This was different. Equal.

"You know a lot about engines, Wade Turner?" she asked.

"Some."

"More than some, I'm guessing. Where'd you learn?"

"My dad's a farmer. Equipment's always breaking down." I shrugged. "And I rebuilt my truck from scrap, so I had to figure out how everything worked."

"The black Chevy in the lot?"

"Yeah."

"That's impressive." She said it matter-of-fact, not flirty or trying to butter me up. Just stating an observation. "How long did it take?"

"About eighteen months. Worked on it whenever I had time." Which was most nights after Pa went to bed, when the house was quiet and I could lose myself in metal and motion and problems that had actual solutions.

"What was wrong with it?"

"Everything." I couldn't help the half-smile. "Engine was seized, transmission shot, body was rust and holes. But the frame was solid, so I started there and built up."

"Did you do it all yourself?"

"Yeah. Couldn't afford to pay someone, and honestly, I liked figuring it out. There's something satisfying about taking something broken and making it work."

She nodded like that made perfect sense to her. "My dad says the same thing. He's always taking apart appliances to see how they work, then putting them back together."

"That what he does? Fix appliances?"

"No, he's regional manager for an agricultural equipment company. But he loves mechanical systems. How things fit together, why they work." She leaned against her car. "He'd like you. You speak the same language."

I didn't know what to say to that, so I grabbed my bag. "You should get that distributor cap replaced soon as you can. This won't hold more than a day or two."

"Where's the auto parts store?"

"Main Street, across from the hardware store. Harper's Auto Parts. Tell them you need a distributor cap for a fifty-four Ford. They'll know which one."

"Thank you." She paused, and I saw her making a decision. "Can I ask you something else?"

"Sure."

"Do you know where the good diners are in this town? I've been eating cafeteria food and gas station sandwiches since we got here, and I'm pretty sure actual food exists somewhere."

The question caught me off-guard. Was she asking me out? Or just making conversation? Her expression didn't give anything away—just calm and direct, waiting for an answer.

"Harper's Diner on Main Street," I said. "Only real option in Oakdale, but the food's decent. Diane Harper's family runs it."

"Would you want to show me sometime? As a thank you for fixing my car?"

My brain stuttered. She was asking me to dinner. The new girl who didn't know I was trouble, didn't know about my reputation, was casually asking me to show her the diner like it was the most normal thing in the world.

"Maybe," I heard myself say.

"Okay." She smiled—just a little, like she found something amusing. "Thanks again for the help, Wade."

She got in her car and pulled out of the lot, the engine running rough but functional. I stood there with my bag and my confusion, trying to figure out what had just happened.

"Smooth, Turner. Real smooth."

I turned to find Tommy leaning against his Ford, grinning like an idiot.

"What?"

"The new girl just asked you out and you said maybe?"

"She asked if I'd show her the diner. That's not asking me out."

"Wade." Tommy shook his head. "For a guy who can rebuild an entire truck engine, you're amazingly stupid about people."

"Shut up."

"She fixed her hair before she asked you. And she was nervous—I saw her hands fidgeting with her keys. That's not 'just making conversation.' That's asking you out."

"You're wrong."

"Am I?" He pushed off his truck. "Look, I've known you since third grade. You've never said maybe to anything. You say yes or no, usually no. The fact that you said maybe means you're interested."

"I'm not interested."

"Then why are you still standing here watching where her car went?"

I wasn't. Except I was. "She'll be gone in six months anyway. Everyone leaves Oakdale."

"Maybe. Or maybe she stays." Tommy headed for the driver's side. "Either way, she's here now, and she doesn't know you're supposedly the town troublemaker. That's a gift, man. Don't waste it because you're scared."

"I'm not scared."

"Sure you're not." He climbed into his truck. "See you tomorrow, Wade. Try not to think about her all night."

He drove off, still grinning, and I was left alone in the parking lot with the afternoon sun beating down and Tommy's words circling in my head.

She doesn't know you're supposedly the town troublemaker.

That was the thing, wasn't it? To Audrey Palmer, I wasn't Wade Turner, Marcus Turner's disappointment. I was just some guy who fixed her distributor cap. Some guy who knew about engines. And for five minutes, standing next to her car, I got to be that person instead of the one this town had decided I was.

It felt good. Better than I wanted to admit.

I climbed into my truck and sat there a minute before starting the engine. My reflection looked back at me from the rearview mirror—leather jacket, bruised knuckles, the armor I wore every day. But for a few minutes with Audrey, I hadn't felt like I needed the armor.

I drove home with the windows down, Tommy's accusation rattling around with everything else. Try not to think about her all night.

Too late for that.

Because I was already replaying the conversation, the way she'd asked direct questions and actually listened to the answers. The way she'd shaken my hand like an equal. The way she'd said "my dad would like you" like that was a good thing, like being someone her father might respect was possible.

Nobody in Oakdale looked at me like I was someone worth knowing. Not anymore. Pa saw disappointment. Teachers saw wasted potential. Girls saw trouble. Ray Coleman saw competition. Even Tommy, my best friend, saw someone who needed saving from himself.

But Audrey had looked at me and seen someone who could fix an engine. Someone worth asking to dinner, even if I'd fumbled the response.

It was such a small thing. One conversation in a parking lot. But it felt bigger than that, like a door opening to a room I hadn't known existed.

The Turner farm appeared on the horizon, white house and red barn against green fields. Home. Prison. Same thing, depending on the day.

I pulled into the drive and cut the engine. Through the kitchen window, I could see Pa at the table, probably doing accounts or reading. He'd ask where I'd been. I'd say school. He'd nod. We'd eat dinner in silence. The usual dance.

But something felt different. Lighter, maybe. Like possibility had crept in when I wasn't looking.

I grabbed my bag and headed inside, and for once, the weight on my shoulders didn't feel quite so heavy.
