# Chapter 9: The Problem With Labels

The following week, word spread that Wade Turner was spending time with Audrey Palmer. In a town like Oakdale, gossip traveled faster than news.

Monday at the diner, Diane pulled me aside while I was waiting for Audrey.

"Can I talk to you a minute?" She had her serious face on, the one she used when she actually cared about something.

"Yeah."

She glanced around to make sure her mom wasn't listening. "People are talking. About you and Audrey."

"Let them talk."

"Wade, I'm serious. Some of the ladies at church asked my mom if Audrey knows about your reputation. Mrs. Henderson said it was only a matter of time before you dragged that nice girl from Atlanta down to your level."

The words stung more than they should have. "What'd you tell them?"

"I told them to mind their own business. But..." She hesitated. "I wanted to warn you. And warn Audrey. Not everyone in town is as understanding as me."

"Understanding of what?"

"Of the fact that you're not actually as bad as people think. You're just angry and hurt." She squeezed my arm. "But Audrey doesn't know you like I do. If enough people warn her off, she might listen."

As if on cue, the diner door opened and Audrey walked in. She spotted us and headed over.

"Hey," she said, then noticed my expression. "What's wrong?"

"Nothing," I said at the same time Diane said, "The town gossips are at it again."

Audrey raised an eyebrow. "About?"

Diane looked at me, then back to Audrey. "People are talking about you two spending time together. Some of them think Audrey should know Wade's reputation before she gets too involved."

I waited for Audrey to ask what that meant, to look at me with doubt or concern. Instead, she just shrugged.

"What do they think my reputation is?" I asked.

"Troublemaker. Rebel. Disappointing son. The usual." Diane sighed. "I don't agree with them, for the record. But I wanted you both to know it's out there."

"Okay," Audrey said simply. "Thanks for the heads-up."

She slid into a booth like nothing had happened, and after a minute, I followed. Diane brought us coffee and disappeared.

"You're not going to ask?" I said finally.

"Ask what?"

"About my reputation. What people are saying."

"I heard what they're saying. Troublemaker, rebel, disappointing son. Is any of it true?"

"Some of it."

"Which parts?"

I wrapped my hands around my coffee cup. "I've been in fights. Race my truck illegally. Argue with my dad constantly. Walked out of the principal's office mid-lecture and got suspended. So yeah, the facts are true."

"Facts and truth aren't always the same thing." She sipped her coffee. "Facts are what you did. Truth is why you did it and who you are because of it. The facts make you sound like trouble. But I know you, and you're not trouble. You're just trying to figure out who you are in a town that already decided for you."

"You might be the only person who sees it that way."

"Then everyone else is wrong."

The simple confidence in her voice made something in my chest loosen. "At school today, some girls tried to warn you off. What'd you tell them?"

She smiled. "I thanked them for their concern and told them I could make my own decisions."

"They probably think I've corrupted you now."

"Good. I was getting bored being the perfect new girl from Atlanta."

Despite everything, I laughed.

Tuesday, Marcus met Mr. Palmer at the farm to discuss equipment for the fall harvest. I was in the barn working on the irrigation pump when they walked through.

"Wade," Pa said, acknowledging me with a nod. "You remember Mr. Palmer."

"Yes, sir." I wiped grease off my hands and shook Mr. Palmer's hand.

"Good to see you again, Wade. Audrey tells me you're quite the mechanic." Mr. Palmer looked at the disassembled pump. "Fixing the irrigation system?"

"Replacing the main bearing. It was grinding itself to death."

"Happens with these older models. You know, our company has newer systems that could save your father thirty percent on water costs. Much more efficient."

I glanced at Pa, saw him considering it. "The pivot irrigation systems?"

"Exactly. You've researched them?"

"Some." I didn't mention that I'd started looking into agricultural technology because of things Audrey had said. "They make sense for operations this size."

Pa looked surprised that I knew anything about it, which shouldn't have hurt but did. Mr. Palmer, though, looked interested.

"If you ever want to learn more about the business side of agricultural equipment, Wade, I'd be happy to show you around our regional office. We're always looking for people who understand both the farming and the mechanical aspects."

"Thank you, sir. I'll think about it."

After they left, Pa stayed behind. We stood there in awkward silence for a minute.

"You've been spending time with Mr. Palmer's daughter," Pa said finally.

Here it came. The lecture about appropriate girls, about reputation, about not embarrassing the family.

"Yeah."

"She seems like a good influence."

I blinked. "What?"

"Mr. Palmer says Audrey's got a good head on her shoulders. Says she judges people by character, not reputation." Pa adjusted his hat. "He thinks well of you. Said Audrey told him you were smart and capable."

"She did?"

"Don't sound so surprised. You are smart and capable when you put your mind to something." He gestured at the pump. "Like this. You didn't just replace the part. You researched better options, found ways to improve the whole system."

I didn't know what to say. Pa never complimented me directly.

"Anyway." He cleared his throat. "Mr. Palmer's a good connection. His company does important work. If you're interested in that kind of thing, might be worth pursuing."

He walked out before I could respond, leaving me standing there confused. Was that approval? Permission? I couldn't tell.

That evening, Audrey came by. We sat on the porch swing her father had mentioned in passing that I'd fixed last summer.

"My dad likes you," she said.

"Your dad barely knows me."

"He knows you fixed my car without expecting anything in return. He knows you're smart about engines and interested in agricultural technology. And he knows I trust you, which means a lot to him." She swung gently. "He thinks you have untapped potential."

"There's that word again."

"It's a good word when people say it right. Wasted potential is an insult. Untapped potential is an opportunity."

"Your dad really offer me a job?"

"Sort of. More like an informal apprenticeship. He does that sometimes with kids who show promise. Teaches them the business, lets them shadow sales calls, shows them how agricultural innovation works." She looked at me. "You interested?"

"Maybe. I don't know." I picked at the porch railing. "People are talking about us. Diane warned me today. Said some of the church ladies think I'm corrupting you."

"Are you?"

"No."

"Then who cares what they think?"

"You don't care that people are judging you for being seen with me?"

"Wade." She stopped the swing and turned to face me. "In Atlanta, people judged me for not wanting to be a debutante. For wearing practical clothes instead of designer ones. For wanting to study engineering instead of finding a husband. I've been judged my whole life. The difference is, this time I'm being judged for doing what I want with someone I choose to spend time with. That's not corruption. That's freedom."

"The town's pretty good at making outsiders feel unwelcome if they want to."

"Let them try." She smiled. "Besides, I'm not planning to care what Oakdale thinks of me. I learned that lesson in Atlanta. If you spend your whole life trying to meet other people's expectations, you never figure out who you actually are."

"How'd you get so smart?"

"Practice. Lots of practice making mistakes and learning from them." She restarted the swing. "You should take my dad up on his offer. Learn about the agricultural equipment business. It's perfect for you—combines farming knowledge with mechanical skills, and you'd get to work with innovation instead of just tradition."

"I'll think about it."

"Good." She was quiet for a moment. "Wade? What people say about you—the reputation, the labels. Do you think they're true?"

"Sometimes. When I'm fighting or racing recklessly or disappointing my dad, yeah, I'm trouble. But other times I'm just trying to figure out who I am, and the labels get in the way."

"Then maybe it's time to stop wearing them. Labels are for other people's convenience, not for your identity."

"Easier said than done in a town where everyone's known you since you were born."

"Maybe. But you're doing it already, bit by bit. Working on the irrigation pump instead of just fixing it the old way. Researching better systems. Talking to my dad about agricultural technology. That's not the disappointing son or the rebel. That's someone choosing what he's interested in."

She was right. Without realizing it, I'd started doing things because I wanted to, not just because they went against what Pa wanted.

"Thanks," I said.

"For what?"

"For not believing the labels. For seeing past them."

"That's the luxury of being new, remember? I get to decide who you are based on who you show me, not on who other people say you've been."

"What if who I show you isn't who I really am?"

"Then you're a really good actor. But I don't think you are. I think you're exactly who you seem to be—someone figuring it out as he goes, making mistakes, trying harder than anyone gives him credit for."

We swung in comfortable silence as the sun set over the cotton fields. And for the first time, I wondered if maybe the labels didn't matter as much as I thought. Maybe Audrey was right—they were for other people's convenience, not for my identity.

Maybe I got to choose who I was, regardless of what the town had decided.
