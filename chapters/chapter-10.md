# Chapter 10: Who He Is Around Her

Saturday morning, Audrey asked if I wanted to help her change her oil. Not because she needed help—she'd already learned how—but because she wanted company. The kind of casual invitation that felt easy and natural, like we'd been friends for years instead of weeks.

We worked in her driveway under the morning sun, me handing her tools, her doing the actual work. It felt backward from how things usually went in Oakdale, where boys did the mechanical work and girls watched or brought lemonade. But I liked it. Liked that she was confident enough to do it herself, liked that she asked me there anyway not to do the work but just to be there.

The whole scene would've scandalized half the town if they'd seen it—the Palmer girl in jeans and a work shirt, grease on her hands, crawling under a car. But that was part of what I liked about Audrey. She didn't care about Oakdale's unwritten rules about what girls should and shouldn't do.

"You know what I realized?" she said, draining the old oil into the pan.

"What?"

"Around you, I can just be myself. I don't have to pretend to be helpless or delicate or any of the things Atlanta wanted me to be. I can change my own oil and talk about engines and you don't think it's weird."

"Why would that be weird?"

"Exactly." She wiped her hands on a rag. "But in Atlanta, boys expected girls to be decorative. Any practical skill was seen as unfeminine. My ex-boyfriend once told me I was 'too capable' for my own good, like that was an insult."

"He sounds like an idiot."

"He was. Took me too long to figure that out." She positioned the new filter. "What about you? Who are you around me that you're not around other people?"

I thought about it while she worked. "Less defensive, I guess. With most people, I'm either performing the rebel act or proving I'm not what they think. But with you, I just... am. Don't have to prove anything or fight against anything."

"Because I don't have expectations."

"Yeah. And because you actually listen when I talk instead of just waiting for me to confirm what you already think."

She finished installing the new filter and started adding fresh oil. "Is that why you haven't let anyone close? Because they all have expectations?"

"Probably. Tommy's my friend, but he knew me before, so he's got the whole history. Everyone else in town sees Marcus Turner's son or the rebel or whatever role they've cast me in. Gets exhausting, always playing a part."

"So don't."

"Easy for you to say."

"Is it?" She closed the hood and started cleaning up. "I spent sixteen years trying to be what my mother wanted, what Atlanta society expected, what my grandmother's friends approved of. It was exhausting. When I came here, I decided to stop. Just be Audrey, take it or leave it."

"How's that working out?"

"Pretty well. Made a good friend, learned about a new town, fixed my own car, ate at a decent diner. No debutante ball could compete."

We washed our hands with the hose, the water cold and clean. I found myself just watching her—the way she moved, confident and sure, no wasted motion. She caught me looking and smiled.

"What?"

"Nothing. Just... you're different."

"Different good or different bad?"

"Different good. You make things feel possible."

"Like what?"

I sat on her porch steps, and she sat beside me. "Like maybe I don't have to choose between the farm and escape. Like maybe there's a middle ground where I can honor where I'm from while still choosing my own path. Like maybe I'm not as stuck as I thought."

"You're not stuck. You're just figuring it out."

"Same thing."

"No, it's not. Stuck is permanent. Figuring it out is temporary." She bumped my shoulder. "Give yourself some credit, Wade. You're doing better than you think."

"Based on what?"

"Based on the fact that you're actually thinking about your future instead of just reacting to your past. You researched irrigation systems because you were interested, not because your dad told you to. You're considering my dad's offer to learn about agricultural equipment. You're engaging instead of just rebelling."

She was right. Without consciously deciding to, I'd started choosing things because I wanted them, not just because they went against what Pa wanted.

"When did that happen?" I asked.

"Gradually. Ever since we started talking." She stood up, offered me her hand. "Come on, I want to show you something."

I followed her inside to her room, which was smaller than the rooms in Atlanta, she'd told me, but felt more like hers. Books on engineering, maps of Georgia, a poster of some agricultural machinery that made me smile.

"Look." She pulled out a notebook, handed it to me.

I opened it to find detailed sketches of irrigation systems, crop rotation plans, sustainable farming techniques. "You drew these?"

"I've been researching. Thinking about how modern agricultural practices could work on family farms like yours. Smaller scale than corporate farming, but innovative enough to compete." She flipped to another page. "This is a water conservation system that could work on the Turner farm. Save money, improve efficiency, and you wouldn't have to change the actual farming practices much."

"Why are you doing this?"

"Because I'm interested. And because I thought it might help you see possibilities." She took the notebook back, flipped through pages she'd obviously spent hours on. "You said you hate farming, but I don't think that's true. I think you hate feeling trapped by tradition, by expectation. But farming with innovation, farming with choice, treating it like problem-solving instead of obligation—that's different. That's engaging with it on your own terms."

I looked at her sketches again—the detailed diagrams, the calculations in the margins, the practical notes about implementation. She'd obviously researched this thoroughly, spent real time thinking about how these systems could work specifically on a farm the size of my family's. "You did all this for me?"

"I did it because I wanted to. Because the challenge interested me." She met my eyes. "But yeah, partly for you. To show you there are options between running away and surrendering. To show you that engaging with where you're from doesn't mean giving up who you want to be."

Something shifted in my chest. Nobody had ever done something like this for me—spent time and effort trying to understand my problem and find solutions. Not to fix me, but to help me see differently.

"Thank you," I said quietly.

"You're welcome." She put the notebook away. "My dad really does want you to shadow him, by the way. He thinks you'd be good at the business side of agricultural innovation."

"I'm still thinking about it."

"Think faster." She grinned. "Opportunity doesn't wait forever."

We went back outside, sat on the porch swing her father had mentioned offhand that I'd repaired last summer when it broke. The afternoon was warm and lazy, typical late June in Georgia, the kind of day where time seemed to slow down. I thought about who I was around Audrey—less guarded, more honest, willing to consider options I'd have dismissed as surrender a month ago.

"Can I ask you something?" I said.

"Always."

"Why me? I mean, you could've made friends with anyone at school. Tommy's nice, Jake's funny, there are girls who'd probably love an Atlanta friend. Why spend time with the town troublemaker?"

She was quiet for a moment, swinging gently. "Honestly? Because you were real. Everyone else at school was performing—trying to be cool or popular or whatever. But you were just... you. Angry and defensive and trying so hard not to care that it was obvious you cared too much. That felt more honest than all the fake smiles and small talk."

"So you liked that I was a mess?"

"I liked that you were authentic. Mess is just part of being human." She looked at me. "Plus, you fixed my car without expecting anything and treated me like a person instead of a girl. That earned points."

"Low bar."

"You'd be surprised how many guys can't clear it."

We sat there swinging, and I realized I liked who I was around Audrey. Less the rebel, less the disappointing son. Just Wade, figuring things out with someone who didn't expect him to have all the answers.

That night, lying in bed, I thought about what Audrey had shown me. Those irrigation sketches, the research she'd done, the time she'd spent trying to understand my perspective. And I thought about what she'd said—that I was engaging instead of just rebelling.

Maybe that was growth. Maybe that was what it looked like to move forward instead of just running away.

And maybe, just maybe, I was starting to become someone Ma would've been proud of.

Not the son Pa wanted, not yet. But someone trying. Someone choosing. Someone real.

That had to count for something.
