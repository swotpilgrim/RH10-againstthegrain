# Chapter 8: What We're Running From

After the races Saturday night, Audrey asked me why I did it. Really asked, not the polite surface question but the deep one.

We were sitting on my tailgate at the overlook, the valley spread out below us in darkness punctured by scattered farmhouse lights. The adrenaline from racing was fading, leaving just the familiar hollow feeling behind.

"Why do you race?" she asked again when I didn't answer right away. "And fight, and cultivate this whole rebel reputation. What's it for?"

I had my practiced answer ready—because I'm good at it, because it pisses off the right people, because why not. But something about the way Audrey waited, patient and genuinely curious, made the rehearsed words stick in my throat.

"I don't know," I said finally.

"Yes, you do."

I looked at her. Those steady gray eyes, no judgment in them, just interest. She really wanted to know.

"It's the only time I feel like myself," I admitted. "Racing, I mean. Everything else in my life is about what other people want or expect. My dad wants me to love the farm. Teachers want me to apply myself. The town wants me to be either the good Turner boy or the bad one, nothing in between. But when I'm racing, none of that matters. It's just me and the truck and the road, and I'm good at it, and nobody can tell me I'm doing it wrong."

Audrey nodded slowly. "What about the fighting?"

"That's different."

"How?"

I picked at the rust on my tailgate. "Fighting's when I can't hold it in anymore. All the frustration and the anger and the feeling like I'm suffocating. Someone says the wrong thing, looks at me the wrong way, and it just... comes out."

"What are you angry about?"

The question was too simple and too complicated at the same time.

"Everything." I laughed, but it sounded bitter even to me. "My mom dying when I was twelve. My dad retreating into the farm like if he just worked hard enough, it would fill the hole she left. Me not being able to be what he wants. This town deciding who I am before I got a chance to figure it out myself. The fact that I don't know what I want, just what I don't want."

"Tell me about your mom."

Nobody asked about Ma. People in Oakdale avoided the topic, treating it like mentioning her would make me break. But Audrey asked it straight, and somehow that made it easier to answer.

"She was good," I said. "Not perfect, but good. Sang while she cooked, laughed at my dad's terrible jokes, believed in me even when I didn't deserve it. When she got sick, it was fast. Three months from diagnosis to funeral. I was twelve, and I didn't understand why God would take someone that good and leave all the mean, petty people walking around perfectly healthy."

"That's a hard question at any age."

"Yeah. My dad dealt with it by working more. I dealt with it by being angry. And we've both been stuck there ever since."

Audrey was quiet for a moment. Then she said, "My mom and I fought constantly before I left. About my future, about who I should be, about everything. One night she told me I was being selfish, throwing away opportunities she never had. I told her I wasn't her second chance, I was my own person. She said I'd understand when I was older. I said maybe I'd understand when she stopped trying to live through me."

"That sounds rough."

"It was. Still is. She calls every Sunday and pretends everything's fine, like I'm just visiting my dad for the summer and I'll come back to Atlanta in the fall and resume the plan. But I'm not going back. I can't." She pulled her knees up, wrapped her arms around them. "I miss her, though. That's the hardest part. I'm angry at her for not accepting me, but I still miss her."

"You can be both," I said.

"Can you? Be angry and still love someone?"

"I think so. I'm furious at my dad most days, but I'd do anything for him. I hate this town, but I'd fight anyone who talked trash about it. Everything's tangled up together."

"So what are you running from? Your dad? The town? Or yourself?"

I'd never thought about it that way. "What's the difference?"

"A lot. If you're running from your dad, that's about your relationship with him. If you're running from the town, that's about needing different surroundings. But if you're running from yourself..." She trailed off.

"Then I take the problem with me."

"Yeah."

We sat in silence, letting that sink in. Around us, the June night was alive with crickets and the distant bark of a dog. The kind of night that felt peaceful if you weren't trapped inside your own head.

"Can I tell you something?" Audrey said eventually.

"Yeah."

"When I left Atlanta, I thought I was running toward freedom. But the first few weeks in Oakdale, I was miserable. New school, no friends, my mom calling every day crying. And I realized the problem wasn't Atlanta. The problem was me expecting geography to fix what was internal."

"What changed?"

"I decided to engage with where I was instead of just using it as escape. Made an effort at school, talked to people, learned about the town. Fixed my own car when it broke instead of calling my dad. Started choosing Oak

dale instead of just hiding there."

"That why you talked to me? Choosing to engage?"

She smiled. "Partly. But mostly because you fixed my distributor cap and didn't act like I should be helpless and grateful. You treated me like a person, not a girl."

"You are a person."

"See? That's what I mean." She bumped my shoulder with hers. "So what are you actually running from, Wade Turner?"

I thought about it. Really thought.

"I'm running from disappointing my dad. From being exactly what everyone expects—the rebel who never amounts to anything. From the fear that maybe they're right, maybe I am just wasted potential." I picked up a rock, turned it over in my hand. "And I'm running from the possibility that if I stop running and actually try, I'll still fail. At least if I don't try, I can say it was on purpose."

Audrey was quiet for a long moment. Then she said, "That's the first honest thing you've said since I met you."

"Gee, thanks."

"I mean it." She turned to face me fully. "Everything else is performance. The rebel act, the leather jacket, the 'I don't care' attitude. But that thing you just said? That was real."

"Real and pathetic."

"Real and human. There's a difference." She picked up her own rock. "You know what I think?"

"What?"

"I think you care too much, not too little. You care what your dad thinks, what the town thinks, whether you're good enough. You care so much it scares you, so you pretend you don't care at all. But the not caring is the lie. The caring is what's true."

She threw her rock out into the darkness. I heard it land somewhere in the grass below.

"Caring isn't weakness," she continued. "Not caring is easy. Fighting is easy. Actually wanting something and risking failure? That takes real courage."

Her words echoed what I'd been thinking but couldn't articulate. And hearing them out loud made them feel both more true and more terrifying.

"What if I try and still fail?" I asked quietly.

"Then you fail. But at least you'll know. At least you won't spend your whole life wondering what if."

"That supposed to be comforting?"

"No. It's supposed to be honest." She looked at me. "You asked me once why I left Atlanta. The real reason is I was scared that if I stayed, I'd wake up at forty and realize I'd lived my mother's life instead of mine. Being scared seemed worse than any risk of failing."

I understood that. Understood it bone deep.

"So what do I do?" I asked.

"Figure out what you actually want. Not what you don't want, not what you're running from. What you want. Then decide if it's worth the risk of trying."

"And if I don't know what I want?"

"Then you start there. You can't run toward something if you don't know what it is."

We sat there a while longer, the valley quiet below us, the weight of the conversation settling in. I felt exposed, like Audrey had peeled back the armor and seen all the fear and confusion underneath. But it didn't feel bad, exactly. Just... honest. Raw.

"Thanks," I said finally.

"For what?"

"For asking the hard questions. For not letting me hide behind the easy answers."

"That's what friends do."

"We're friends?"

"Aren't we?" She smiled. "You fixed my car, showed me your town, let me drive your truck, and just admitted your deepest fears. I'd say that qualifies."

Friends. I hadn't had a real friend besides Tommy in years. Hadn't let anyone close enough.

"Yeah," I said. "I guess we are."

I drove her home, the conversation still circling in my head. What was I running from? What did I actually want? The questions felt bigger than I knew how to answer.

But for the first time, I was asking them. Really asking, not just deflecting.

That had to count for something.

I pulled up to her house and Audrey got out, then leaned back in the window. "Wade? One more thing."

"Yeah?"

"Your mom would be proud of you. For being honest tonight. For trying to figure it out instead of just running."

The words hit like a punch to the chest. "You didn't know my mom."

"No. But I know what it's like to have a parent who sees your potential. And I bet she saw it too."

She walked to her door, and I sat there with tears stinging my eyes that I refused to let fall.

Ma would be proud.

Maybe. Or maybe she'd be disappointed like everyone else.

But Audrey thought she'd be proud, and for some reason, that mattered.

I drove home slowly, the night air cool through the windows, and let myself feel everything I'd been running from. The anger, the fear, the grief, the desperate hope that maybe I could be something more than what everyone expected.

It hurt. But it also felt like the first honest breath I'd taken in five years.
