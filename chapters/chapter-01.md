# Chapter 1: Wrong Side of Right

I woke up to sunlight burning through thin curtains and my ribs reminding me why fighting Tommy Birch's cousin at the drag strip three nights ago was a bad idea. Not that I regretted it—the kid had it coming, running his mouth about my father like he knew anything—but my body sure did. I lay there a minute longer than I should've, staring at the ceiling where the paint peeled in the corner, same corner that'd been peeling since I was ten. Some things in this house never changed, and others changed too much.

The floorboards in the hallway creaked. Pa's footsteps, heavy and deliberate, heading downstairs. Six o'clock, same as every morning since I could remember. Time to get up, time to work, time to be the son he expected instead of the one he got.

I swung my legs out of bed and sat there, elbows on my knees, looking at my knuckles. Purple and yellow now, the swelling mostly gone. My leather jacket hung over the chair, worn at the elbows and smelling like motor oil and cigarettes. I pulled on yesterday's jeans and a white t-shirt, shrugged into the jacket even though the Georgia morning was already warming up. Armor against the whole damn world.

Downstairs, Pa stood at the kitchen counter pouring coffee into the same chipped mug he'd used for twenty years. He didn't turn around when I came in, but I saw his shoulders tense. We'd perfected this dance—me late, him disappointed, both of us pretending it didn't matter.

"Barn needs mucking," he said, his voice flat. "North fence has three posts down. Irrigation pump's making that sound again."

"Yes, sir." I grabbed a piece of toast from the plate on the table, didn't bother sitting down.

Pa finally turned, and I saw him register my bruised knuckles. His jaw tightened, but he didn't say anything about the fight. Why would he? We'd had that conversation a dozen times, and it never ended any way but badly.

"Your brother's coming by after lunch to help with the hay," Pa said. "He's bringing Beth."

Of course he was. My older brother James, who did everything right—married a good local girl, worked the family farm without complaint, wore his responsibility like a badge of honor instead of a chain. I took a bite of toast and said nothing.

Pa set his coffee down and looked at me square. "County fair's in August. Three months. I was thinking you might want to enter something this year. Turner family's always represented—"

"I'm good," I cut him off.

"Wade—"

"I said I'm good." I turned toward the door, couldn't stomach this conversation on top of everything else.

"One of these days you're gonna have to figure out what you're running toward instead of what you're running from."

I stopped with my hand on the screen door, felt the words hit like a punch to those same bruised ribs. But I didn't turn around, didn't give him the satisfaction. Just pushed through the door and let it slam behind me.

The morning air smelled like red clay and growing cotton, the sun already fierce enough to promise a scorcher by noon. I walked toward the barn, past the machinery shed where I'd spent half of last summer rebuilding a tractor engine Pa said was beyond saving. I'd proved him wrong about that, at least. Not that it mattered. One point for Wade didn't change the scoreboard.

The chores took three hours. Mucking stalls, fixing fence posts, checking the irrigation pump that sounded like it was grinding itself to death. I worked mechanical and resentful, the way I did most things on this farm. Pa watched from a distance, and I felt his disappointment like humidity—thick, inescapable, soaking into everything.

By the time I cleaned up and headed to school, I was already an hour late. Didn't matter. Nothing they taught me at Oakdale High was gonna help me get out of this town anyway.

I pulled my truck into the parking lot just as third period bell rang. The building looked exactly like what it was—a small-town Georgia school that'd seen better days, red brick fading to rust, windows that stuck in summer and let in cold in winter. I'd been walking these hallways since I was six years old, and every year they felt smaller.

Made it halfway to English class before I heard my name on the intercom.

"Wade Turner, report to Principal Harrison's office immediately."

I stopped in the hallway, couple of sophomore girls pressing themselves against lockers like I might explode if they got too close. Maybe I would. I turned around and headed for the administrative wing, each step feeling heavier than the last.

Principal Harrison's office smelled like old paper and disappointment. Funny how those two things always seemed to go together in my life.

"Sit down, Wade." Harrison gestured to the chair across from his desk. He was a thin man, mid-fifties, with round glasses that made him look like an owl. A tired owl who'd seen too many kids like me come through his office.

I sat. Didn't take off my jacket.

"I received a call from Sheriff Dotson this morning," Harrison said, folding his hands on top of a folder I recognized—my file, probably thick with incident reports by now. "About an altercation at the drag strip Sunday night."

"That so?" I kept my voice level.

"Don't play games with me, son. You put Danny Birch in the clinic with a split lip and a black eye."

"He put himself there. I just helped."

Harrison sighed, the kind of sigh that said he was pulling out his standard lecture, the one I could recite by heart. "Wade, you're seventeen years old. You're smart—smarter than you let on. Your teachers tell me when you bother to do the work, it's good work. You've got potential."

There it was. Potential. My favorite word.

"But you're wasting it," Harrison continued. "Fighting, racing that truck of yours like you've got a death wish, disappointing your father who's one of the most respected men in this county—"

I stood up. Couldn't help it. Couldn't sit there and listen to one more person tell me who my father was and who I wasn't.

"Where do you think you're going? I'm not finished—"

"Yeah, you are." I headed for the door.

"Wade Turner, you walk out of here and you're suspended. Three days."

I stopped with my hand on the doorknob. Three days at home with Pa's silent disappointment sounded worse than three days in hell, but staying here listening to this sounded worse than both. I pulled open the door.

"Your father deserves better than this," Harrison called after me.

I didn't turn around. Just kept walking down that hallway, past the sophomore girls who'd probably spread the story by lunch, past the trophy case full of awards for kids who played by the rules and won at games that mattered to someone.

The parking lot was empty except for teachers' cars baking in the sun. I climbed into my truck—a '54 Chevy I'd rebuilt myself, painted black—and turned the key. The engine rumbled to life, familiar and reliable in a way nothing else seemed to be.

I should've gone home. Should've faced Pa and gotten the lecture over with, taken my punishment like a man. Instead, I drove.

Past Main Street with Harper's Diner and the hardware store, past the drag strip turnoff, out onto the county road cutting through cotton fields stretching to the horizon.

The cotton was coming in strong this year, bright green plants in neat rows, thousands of them, all growing exactly where they were planted. I looked at those fields and felt my chest tighten.

This is what they wanted for me. Roots in this red Georgia clay, growing in neat rows, predictable and contained. Three generations of Turners had planted themselves here and been content. Pa loved this land the way some men loved their wives, with a devotion I couldn't understand.

I'd tried, back when Ma was alive. Back when I was eight or nine, following Pa through the fields, his hand on my shoulder, pride in his voice. Then Ma died and Pa retreated into the farm, and I just felt trapped.

I pulled over on the shoulder, cut the engine, and sat there looking at those endless rows of cotton. Prison bars, green and growing. Beautiful, if you were the kind of person who could see beauty in confinement.

My knuckles ached where they gripped the steering wheel. Bruised from fighting, calloused from farm work I resented doing. I didn't know what I wanted—didn't let myself think that far ahead most days—but I knew what I didn't want. This. All of this.

The town where everybody knew everything, where your last name mattered more than who you were. The expectations pressing down like humidity. The future already planned out, just waiting for me to stop fighting and accept it.

I was Wade Turner, Marcus Turner's disappointing son, the rebel who wouldn't fall in line, the boy with potential he was wasting. That's who they said I was, and most days I believed them. Not because I wanted to, but because it was easier than trying to be anything else.

A car passed on the county road, slowed down like maybe they recognized my truck, then sped up again. Probably headed into town to spread the word that Marcus Turner's boy was parked on the roadside in the middle of a school day, confirming everything everyone already thought about me.

Let them talk. They were gonna anyway.

I started the engine and pulled back onto the road. Windows down, radio playing Elvis, driving nowhere in particular. Just trying not to think about the three-day suspension I'd just earned, another layer of disappointment on top of all the rest.

The sun climbed higher. My ribs ached with every breath. Somewhere back in town, Principal Harrison was probably calling my father right now. By the time I got home, Pa would be waiting with that same expression—not angry, that would've been easier. Just disappointed.

I drove past the Turner farm and kept going. Wasn't ready for the conversation, the lecture, the silent meal where we pretended this was something new instead of the same fight we'd been having for five years.

Three generations of Turners on this land, and I was gonna be the one who broke the chain. Only question was how much I'd disappoint them before I finally escaped.

The cotton fields stretched on forever, and I drove through them like a man trying to outrun his own shadow.
