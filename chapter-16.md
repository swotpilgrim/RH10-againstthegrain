# Chapter 16: When the Town Notices

Sunday morning, and I could feel eyes on me the second we walked through the church doors.

It wasn't anything new—people in Oakdale had been watching me for years, waiting for the next fight or the next disappointment. But this was different. This wasn't the usual wariness, the mothers pulling their daughters a little closer when I passed. This was curiosity mixed with something sharper. Judgment, maybe. Or speculation.

I slid into the back pew like always, my father and brother taking their usual spots three rows up with Beth. Marcus had given up trying to make me sit with the family years ago. But even from the back, I heard the whispers.

"...spending all his time with that Palmer girl..."

"...hasn't been in a fight in weeks, have you noticed..."

"...wonder if she knows what she's getting into..."

I kept my eyes forward, jaw tight, hands clasped between my knees. The service dragged on forever—Pastor Williams going on about redemption and second chances, which felt pointed enough that a few heads turned my way. I counted ceiling tiles. Studied the stained glass. Tried to ignore the feeling of being dissected.

When we finally got out, the church ladies descended on my father like vultures in Sunday hats.

"Marcus, we've noticed your Wade's been different lately," Mrs. Henderson said, her voice sweet as arsenic. "That new girl from Atlanta—Audrey Palmer, isn't it? Such a sweet thing. Does she know about Wade's...history?"

My father's expression didn't change. "Wade's eighteen this fall. Old enough to make his own choices about who he spends time with."

"Of course, of course," Mrs. Coleman chimed in—Ray's mother, naturally. "We just worry, you know. City girls aren't used to our ways. And Wade's always been so...spirited."

Spirited. That was a new one. Usually they went with troublemaker or disappointment.

I walked past them without a word, heading for my truck. But not before I heard Mrs. Henderson's stage whisper: "Give it time. Boys like that don't change. She'll figure it out soon enough."

Harper's Diner was packed after church, same as every Sunday. Families filled the vinyl booths, farmers congregated at the counter, and the smell of bacon grease and coffee hung thick in the air. I hadn't planned on stopping, but Tommy flagged me down from his usual table by the window.

"You eating?" he asked when I slid into the booth across from him.

"Just coffee."

Diane appeared with the pot before I finished the sentence. "Coffee for the mystery man," she said, flipping over my cup. "Whole town's talking about you, Wade Turner."

"Yeah, I noticed."

She poured, then leaned against the table edge, not bothering to lower her voice. "There's two camps. Group one thinks Audrey Palmer's a good influence, that you're finally settling down and showing some sense. Group two thinks you're putting on a show, that you'll go back to your old ways once she gets bored and moves back to Atlanta."

"What do you think?" I asked, even though I wasn't sure I wanted the answer.

Diane studied me for a long moment. "I think you're trying. Whether you make it stick or not, that's on you." She moved off to refill cups down the counter, leaving me and Tommy in uncomfortable silence.

"She's not wrong," Tommy said finally. "People are watching."

"People are always watching."

"Not like this." He pushed his eggs around his plate. "Before, they'd written you off. Now they're invested. They want to see how it turns out."

I took a drink of coffee, letting it burn down my throat. At the counter, three farmers I'd known my whole life were deep in conversation. One of them—Mr. Harris, who'd given me my first job bucking hay when I was fourteen—glanced over at me, then back to his companions. Their voices were low, but I caught fragments.

"...Turner's boy..."

"...actually showed up on time at the feed store..."

"...money says it won't last..."

"...never does with that type..."

That type. Like I was a category, not a person.

"It's getting to you," Tommy observed.

"It's not." But my knuckles were white around the coffee cup.

"Look, I'm just saying—if this thing with Audrey doesn't work out, you're going to look like a fool. Everyone will say they knew it all along."

I set the cup down carefully, working to keep my voice even. "You think I'm doing this for Audrey?"

"Aren't you?"

The question hit harder than it should have. "I'm trying to figure out what I actually want instead of just being pissed off all the time. That's not about her."

"Isn't it though?" Tommy's expression was worried, not mean. "Three months ago you didn't give a damn about any of this. Then she shows up and suddenly you're Mr. Respectable. You can see how that looks."

Yeah. I could see exactly how it looked.

---

The scrutiny followed me everywhere that week. At school, teachers watched me with surprised approval when I turned in assignments on time. At the feed store where I picked up supplies for my father, the clerk actually thanked me instead of watching to make sure I didn't steal anything. Even the sheriff nodded when he passed me on Main Street, like I was a citizen instead of a problem.

It should have felt good. Validation, or whatever. But instead it felt like wearing a costume that didn't quite fit, like everyone was waiting for me to mess up the lines.

Friday afternoon, I was loading fifty-pound feed bags into the truck bed when Ray Coleman pulled up in his beat-to-hell Chevy. He leaned out the window, grinning like he'd just won something.

"Wade Turner, working hard. Never thought I'd see the day."

I kept loading. "Ray."

"Heard you've been real busy lately. Keeping your nose clean, playing the good boy for that pretty city girl." He killed his engine and got out, leaning against his truck. "It's impressive, really. The whole transformation act. Very convincing."

"Not an act."

"Sure it is." He lit a cigarette, taking his time. "See, I know guys like you. Hell, I used to be guys like you before I grew up. You think if you pretend to be someone different, she won't notice what you really are. But she will, Wade. Girls always do. And when she figures out you're still the same screwup you've always been, she's going to leave. Probably go back to Atlanta where she belongs."

My hands stilled on the feed bag. Every muscle in my body wanted to drop it and put my fist through Ray's smug face. It would feel so good—the impact, the satisfaction, the familiar rush of not caring about consequences.

But I didn't move.

"Nothing to say?" Ray pushed. "Or are you too civilized now for an honest fight?"

I picked up the last bag, loaded it, slammed the tailgate shut. "I've got nothing to prove to you, Ray."

"That's what guys say when they're lying to themselves."

I got in the truck and drove away, hands shaking on the wheel. My jaw ached from clenching it. Not fighting felt harder than any punch I'd ever thrown, and Ray knew it. They all knew it. They were waiting for me to crack, to prove I was exactly who they'd always said I was.

That night, Tommy came by the farm. Found me in the barn, supposedly organizing tools but really just trying to burn off the anger still simmering under my skin.

"Heard about Ray," he said, settling on an overturned crate.

"Word travels fast."

"You okay?"

I slammed a wrench into its drawer harder than necessary. "Fine."

"Wade."

"I said I'm fine."

But I wasn't fine. I was exhausted. Trying so hard, every single day, to be different—to think before I reacted, to walk away from fights, to care about things I'd spent years pretending didn't matter. And for what? So church ladies could whisper about me? So Ray Coleman could call me a fake? So my best friend could worry I was going to make a fool of myself?

"Look," Tommy said carefully, "if this doesn't work out—with Audrey, I mean—people are going to talk. You know that, right? They're going to say they knew all along you hadn't changed."

"I know."

"And that doesn't bother you?"

I turned to face him. "Of course it bothers me. But what am I supposed to do? Stop trying because people are watching? Go back to fighting and racing just to prove I don't care what anyone thinks?"

"No, but—" He struggled for words. "I just don't want to see you get hurt, man. And I don't want to see you change yourself into someone you're not because you think that's what she wants."

There it was. The question underneath all the scrutiny, all the whispers, all the waiting for me to fail.

Was I actually changing? Or was I just performing change because of Audrey?

"I don't know," I said quietly. "I honestly don't know anymore."

Tommy's face fell. "Wade—"

"No, I mean it. I thought I knew. I thought I was figuring out what I actually wanted instead of just being angry all the time. But everyone's watching, waiting for me to screw up, and half the time I don't know if I'm doing this because I want to be different or because I'm trying to prove something to people who've already decided who I am."

"And Audrey?"

I sat down on the workbench, suddenly tired. "I don't want to be a disappointment to her too."

"That's not the same as wanting to change for yourself."

"I know." The admission hurt. "I know it's not."

We sat in silence for a while, the barn settling around us in creaks and whispers. Outside, crickets started their evening chorus. The farm smelled like it always did—dirt and hay and gasoline and work. Familiar. Safe.

Or maybe just familiar. Maybe I'd confused familiar with safe for so long I didn't know the difference anymore.

"What are you going to do?" Tommy asked finally.

I didn't have an answer. For the first time in weeks, I genuinely didn't know what came next. The scrutiny pressed down like Georgia heat, inescapable and suffocating. Everyone watching. Everyone waiting.

Everyone certain they already knew how this ended.

And the worst part? I was starting to wonder if they were right.
