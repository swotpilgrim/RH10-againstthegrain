# BIBLE: Against the Grain

## Story Premise

Wade Turner is seventeen and completely wrong for Oakdale, Georgia. His farmer father expects Wade to take over the family farm and become a pillar of the community like three generations before him, but Wade can't stand the thought of being stuck on the same land his whole life. He drag races, fights, and rebels against everyone's expectations until Audrey Palmer moves to town from Atlanta. She doesn't know his reputation, doesn't judge him, and actually sees past the rebel armor to who he really is. Through Audrey, Wade learns that real rebellion isn't running from what you don't want—it's figuring out what you do want and fighting for that on your own terms.

## Protagonist: Wade Turner

**Age:** 17

**Background:** Born and raised in Oakdale, Georgia, son of Marcus Turner who owns one of the biggest farms in the county. Three generations of Turners have worked this land, and Wade's expected to be the fourth. His mother died when he was twelve, leaving just him and his father in a house full of disappointment and unmet expectations. Wade's older brother followed the plan—married a local girl, works the farm—which makes Wade's rebellion stand out even more.

**Personality:** Restless, defiant, frustrated. Wade's got his father's stubbornness but none of his contentment with small-town life. He's quick to fight when someone challenges him, faster to walk away when someone tries to pin him down. Underneath the rebel exterior, he's deeply uncertain—he knows what he doesn't want but has no idea what he does want. Smart enough to excel at farming if he cared, talented with mechanics and engines, but deliberately underachieving because trying feels like surrendering. He's got a sharp tongue when cornered and uses sarcasm as armor. Around people who've written him off, he leans into the bad boy reputation because it's easier than trying to prove them wrong. But alone, working on an engine or driving too fast on empty roads, he's quieter—wrestling with the fear that everyone might be right about him. He's fiercely loyal to the few people who believe in him but pushes away anyone who gets too close to the real vulnerability underneath.

**Goal:** Wade wants out of Oakdale and away from the farm, though he has no actual plan for where he'd go or what he'd do. Mostly he wants to stop disappointing his father while also not becoming the person his father wants him to be—an impossible contradiction he hasn't figured out yet.

**Fear/Obstacle:** Wade's terrified that if he stops rebelling, he'll disappear into the life everyone's planned for him. He's also afraid that his rebellion is all he is—that without the fighting and the drag racing and the reputation, there's nothing substantial underneath.

**Arc:** Wade begins as someone who defines himself entirely by what he's against. Through Audrey, he learns to articulate what he's for. By the end, he's still going against the grain, but purposefully—choosing to modernize and innovate within farming rather than blindly rejecting it, finding his own path that honors his roots while making them his own.

## Love Interest: Audrey Palmer

**Age:** 16

**Background:** Just moved to Oakdale from Atlanta with her father, who took a job as regional manager for an agricultural equipment company. Her mother stayed in Atlanta to finish her own nursing degree—the family's separated temporarily but amicably. Audrey chose to come to Oakdale with her father instead of staying in Atlanta with her mother because her mother's family had very specific expectations about who Audrey should be (debutante, sorority girl, marry well). Moving felt like freedom.

**Personality:** Practical, curious, straightforward. Audrey's good with her hands and genuinely interested in how things work—engines, machinery, systems. She's quieter than Wade but not shy; she just doesn't waste words. Coming from Atlanta, she's less impressed by small-town hierarchies and reputations than Oakdale natives. She sees people clearly because she doesn't have years of context clouding her judgment. Independent-minded without being rebellious—she simply knows what she wants and pursues it calmly. She has the confidence that comes from making a hard choice (leaving Atlanta) and standing by it. Audrey doesn't try to fix people or change them; she's more interested in understanding why they are the way they are. She asks direct questions that make Wade uncomfortable because they require honest answers. She's comfortable with silence, which unnerves people used to southern social chatter. Her matter-of-fact approach to life—this is the problem, here's the solution—clashes with Oakdale's tendency to talk around difficult things. She's patient but not a pushover; if you waste her time, she'll walk away without drama.

**Initial Barrier:** Wade assumes Audrey will judge him like everyone else in Oakdale does. He's also convinced she's temporary—that a girl from Atlanta won't stay in a place like this—so getting close to her feels risky. She's also the daughter of his father's new business connection, which complicates things.

**Hidden Depth:** Audrey understands Wade's frustration with expectations because she's lived it—just in a different context. She's not trying to fix Wade or change him; she's trying to help him figure out what he actually wants instead of just running from what he doesn't want. Her calm certainty about her own choices challenges Wade's chaos.

**Arc:** Audrey starts as the observant outsider and becomes Wade's mirror—showing him that choosing your path and running away are different things. She helps him see that rebellion without purpose is just noise, and that real courage is being honest about what you want even when it's complicated.

## Supporting Cast

### Marcus Turner (Father)
Wade's father, early fifties, third-generation farmer who loves the land and can't understand why his son doesn't. Stern, disappointed, but not cruel—he genuinely believes farming is a good life and that Wade's throwing away something valuable. Tall and weathered from years of sun and physical labor, hands permanently stained from working the soil. After Wade's mother died, Marcus retreated into work and expectations, struggling to connect with a son he doesn't understand. He sees Wade's rebellion as disrespect rather than desperation. The more Wade fights, the more Marcus digs in, creating a cycle neither knows how to break. He's respected in the community as a fair employer and solid citizen, which makes Wade's reputation more painful—people see it as Marcus raising his boy wrong. Underneath the disappointment is genuine love and fear that Wade will waste his potential or get himself killed drag racing. He's traditional but not stupid; he knows farming is changing and the old ways won't last forever. He just can't admit that out loud without feeling like he's betraying his own father. Functions as the primary external obstacle and eventual ally when Wade approaches farming on his own terms with respect instead of rage.

### Tommy Birch (Best Friend)
Wade's best friend since childhood, also seventeen, also from a farming family but perfectly content with that future. Sandy-haired, easygoing, the kind of guy everyone likes because he doesn't cause trouble. Works at his family's feed store after school and weekends, plans to take it over someday and is genuinely happy about it. Loyal to Wade but increasingly worried that Wade's rebellion is going to get him hurt or run out of town. Tommy represents the path Wade's expected to follow—accepting your lot, finding happiness in the familiar. He doesn't understand Wade's restlessness but he doesn't judge it either; he just wishes Wade would settle down before something bad happens. Sometimes goes to the drag strip with Wade, more to keep an eye on him than because he enjoys it. Voices concern that Wade's changing for Audrey instead of for himself, which forces Wade to examine his motivations. The friendship strains in the middle when Tommy says Wade's letting a girl mess with his head, but eventually supports Wade when he realizes Wade's finally fighting for something instead of against everything. Tommy's steady contentment highlights Wade's struggle—why can't Wade just be satisfied like everyone else?

### Diane Harper (Audrey's Friend)
Oakdale native, sixteen, brunette with a quick smile and quicker wit. Works at the town diner her family owns, has been serving coffee and gossip since she was tall enough to reach the counter. One of the few people in town who's friendly to both Wade (because she's known him forever and remembers when he wasn't so angry) and Audrey (because she's curious about the new girl from the city and hungry for something different). Serves as Audrey's guide to Oakdale's social dynamics and Wade's history—tells Audrey the truth about Wade's reputation without the judgment attached. Protective of both of them and pushes back when the town gossips at the diner counter, though she has to do it carefully since her family's business depends on staying in everyone's good graces. Represents the good side of small-town community—people who see beyond reputation and remember who you used to be before life beat you down. She's trapped in Oakdale too but has made peace with it by finding joy in small rebellions like defending the town outcasts. Her loyalty to Wade comes from remembering his mother's funeral and seeing how lost he looked; she never forgot that vulnerability.

### Ray Coleman (Rival)
Twenty years old, works on a neighboring farm, recently engaged to a local girl and loving the role of responsible young man. Broad-shouldered and confident in the way guys are when life's going according to plan. Takes every opportunity to point out Wade's failures and rebellion, partly because he's genuinely judgmental about people who don't respect tradition and partly because making Wade look bad makes Ray look better by comparison. Ray's the golden boy who does everything right—works hard, goes to church, treats his girl proper, respects his elders. He resents that Wade has opportunities (family farm, father's respect waiting if he'd just take it) and throws them away while Ray has to work twice as hard for half the recognition. Escalates to confrontation when Wade starts spending time with Audrey, suggesting Wade's going to corrupt her or drag her down the way he drags down everything he touches. The fight between them forces the crisis that makes Wade examine whether he's actually changing or just performing change for Audrey's benefit. Ray represents the judgment of the community made flesh—the voice that says Wade will never be good enough, never change, never be worth the trouble.

### Mr. Palmer (Audrey's Father)
Regional manager for agricultural equipment company, early forties, practical and progressive about farming methods. Lean and energetic, talks enthusiastically about crop rotation and soil conservation and modern machinery efficiency. Relocated from Atlanta for this job and genuinely excited about it—sees agricultural innovation as the future, not stuck in the past like many Oakdale farmers. Sees potential in Wade that Wade doesn't see in himself; notices Wade's mechanical aptitude and quick understanding of how systems work. Friendly with Marcus Turner through business but doesn't buy into the town's judgment of Wade—he's an outsider too and knows reputations aren't always accurate. Quietly encourages Wade's interest in modern farming techniques, lends him agricultural journals and equipment manuals, talks to him like he's capable instead of like he's a disappointment. Trusts Audrey's judgment about people completely; if she sees something worth knowing in Wade, that's good enough for him. Represents possibility of different kind of authority figure—one who believes in potential instead of just demanding conformity. His presence in Wade's life shows Wade what supportive fatherhood could look like, which makes his own father's disappointment harder but also gives him a model for change.

### Beth Turner (Sister-in-law)
Married to Wade's older brother, mid-twenties, kind but conventional. Blonde, always put-together, keeps a perfect house and never complains. Firmly planted in Oakdale life and happy there—loves being a farmer's wife, volunteers at church, hosts Sunday dinners, does everything "right." Sometimes tries to mediate between Wade and Marcus but usually just makes Wade feel more trapped by suggesting he "try harder" to fit in or "think about how hard this is on your father." Genuinely doesn't understand why Wade's unhappy—she thinks if he'd just stop fighting and accept his life, he'd find the same contentment she has. Represents the life Wade's supposed to want but finds suffocating—marriage, farm, community respect, predictability. She's not malicious, just limited in imagination. Can't conceive that someone might want a different kind of happiness than she's found. Her gentle pressure and well-meaning advice make Wade feel more isolated because she makes it seem so easy to just surrender to expectations. When Wade starts working on his agriculture project, she's confused but supportive in her way, though she still doesn't really understand why he couldn't just do things the normal way.

## Setting: Oakdale, Georgia

**Time:** Summer 1957

**Key Locations:**
- **Turner Family Farm:** 300 acres of cotton and tobacco, white farmhouse that's been in the family for generations, machinery barn where Wade works on engines when he's supposed to be doing other things, fields that represent both legacy and trap.
- **Oakdale Main Street:** Small downtown with diner (Harper's), feed store (Birch's), hardware store, church, courthouse square where everyone sees everything—the center of town judgment and gossip.
- **Drag Racing Strip:** Unofficial stretch of rural highway where Wade and other restless boys race on weekend nights, away from town supervision, representing freedom and recklessness in equal measure.
- **County Agriculture Fair Grounds:** Site of annual summer fair where the farming community gathers, displays produce and livestock, socializes—where Wade's project becomes public and his redemption plays out before the whole town.

**Period Details:** Georgia summer heat and humidity, cotton fields ready for harvest, 1950s pickup trucks and hot rods, church socials as major social events, rigid expectations about respectability and family legacy, agricultural traditions passed down through generations, tension between old farming methods and new techniques becoming available.

**Atmosphere:** Claustrophobic small-town South where everyone knows everyone's business and family reputation matters intensely. Beautiful land that feels like a prison to Wade. Thick summer air that makes everything feel slow and stuck. The weight of tradition and expectation pressing down on anyone who wants something different. Judgment delivered in polite voices over church potluck. The kind of place where leaving feels like failure and staying feels like surrender.

## Tone & Voice

First-person POV from Wade's perspective. His narrative voice is frustrated, restless, and sharp—quick to defensiveness but capable of surprising insight when he's honest with himself. Southern rural cadence without heavy dialect; authentic teenage male voice that's more likely to deflect with sarcasm than admit vulnerability directly. Internal monologue reveals the fear and confusion beneath his rebellious exterior. As the story progresses, his voice gains clarity and purpose—less reactive anger, more purposeful determination. The narration should feel like sitting with a smart, angry boy who's slowly figuring out that being angry isn't the same as knowing what you want. Emotional accessibility balanced with masculine restraint typical of 1950s rural South.

## Theme

Real rebellion isn't rejecting everything—it's choosing what you stand for. Wade learns that fighting against expectations without knowing what you're fighting for is just noise. True courage is the vulnerability of admitting what you actually want, even when it's complicated or doesn't fit neat categories. You can honor your roots while still growing in your own direction. Sometimes the bravest thing is engaging with the life you're given and transforming it rather than just running away. Love doesn't fix you, but it can help you see yourself clearly enough to do your own fixing.

## Romance Trope(s)

The Misunderstood Bad Boy who's labeled rebellious but is actually just lost, paired with the Outsider Girl who sees past his reputation because she has no context for it. "She sees the real me" dynamic where Audrey's lack of preconceptions allows Wade to be honest with himself. Redemption arc driven by love but not dependent on it—Audrey inspires Wade's change but doesn't perform it for him. Mutual understanding between two people who've both felt trapped by others' expectations. The relationship succeeds because they're both choosing their own paths, not because one saves the other.
