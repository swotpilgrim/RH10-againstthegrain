# Chapter 28: The Future, Specific

Sunday morning, the last day of the fair.

I arrived at my booth early, before the crowds, to find three messages waiting. Two from farmers who'd attended my presentation wanting to discuss consulting on their own operations. One from the state agricultural extension about their university partnership program.

Real interest. Real opportunities. Real possibilities extending beyond the county fair.

The morning was steady—farmers stopping by for technical discussions, families browsing displays, kids dragging parents through on their way to more exciting attractions. Each conversation reinforced that this work mattered. Not just to me, but to the broader community of people trying to keep family farming viable.

Around ten, Mr. Palmer appeared with David Chen, the regional director I'd met yesterday.

"Wade, do you have a few minutes?" Mr. Palmer asked.

"Of course."

We stepped away from the booth to a quieter area. David Chen carried a folder and the purposeful expression of someone about to make an official proposal.

"I've been reviewing your project in detail," Chen said. "Discussing it with our leadership team. We're impressed with the integration of traditional practices and modern sustainability measures. It's exactly the kind of innovation we're trying to support across family farming operations."

I nodded, not sure where this was going.

"Our company works with hundreds of small to mid-size farms across three states," he continued. "Many are facing the same challenges you addressed in your proposal—water scarcity, soil depletion, generational transition. We'd like to develop your sustainable farming model into a broader consultation framework we could offer to other family farms."

My brain stuttered. "You want to—what?"

"Partner with you," Mr. Palmer said, smiling at my expression. "Develop your model, test it on multiple operations, create implementation guides. Paid consultation work."

"I'm seventeen."

"You'll be eighteen soon," Chen said. "And starting senior year. We're proposing part-time work during the school year—maybe ten hours a week, flexible scheduling. You'd work with our agricultural team, learn the business side of farm equipment and sustainability consulting, help adapt your proposal for different operation sizes and crops."

He handed me the folder. Inside was a formal proposal—hourly wages that seemed impossibly high for a high school student, a detailed job description, projected timeline.

"This would give you real-world experience in agricultural consulting," Mr. Palmer added. "Look great on college applications, especially for agricultural science programs. Build your expertise while you're still in school."

"And after graduation?" I asked, still trying to process.

"Potentially full-time work while you're in college, if you want it. Or just summer work. Flexible depending on your academic path." Chen met my eyes. "We think you have a real future in this field, Wade. This is us investing in that future."

A future. Specific and concrete. Agricultural consulting, helping family farms modernize sustainably. Paid work doing something I actually believed in.

Six weeks ago, my future had been a vague desperate need to escape. Now someone was offering me a path forward that made sense, that fit who I was and what I cared about.

"I'd need to discuss it with my father," I said. "Make sure it doesn't interfere with farm obligations."

"Of course. We'd be flexible with scheduling. Talk it over, and let me know by end of next week." Chen shook my hand. "We're excited about this possibility."

After they left, I stood there holding the folder, trying to make my brain work properly.

This was real. Not a daydream or fantasy, but an actual concrete opportunity. A future I could see clearly.

That afternoon, I found Audrey at the overlook.

Not the overlook near the Turner farm, but the one at the edge of the fairgrounds where you could see the whole valley spread out below. She sat on the hood of her car, hair lifting in the breeze, looking out at the landscape.

I climbed up next to her.

"You found me," she said.

"You said you'd be here."

We sat in comfortable silence for a minute. Below us, the fair continued—the last day before everyone packed up and went back to regular life. But from up here, it all looked small. Temporary. The valley beyond stretched out permanent and patient.

"Mr. Palmer's company offered me a job," I said.

Audrey turned to look at me. "Yeah?"

I told her about the proposal—the part-time consulting work, the partnership developing my sustainable farming model, the possibility of it continuing through college. As I talked, it became more real. More possible.

"Wade, that's incredible," Audrey said when I finished.

"It's not what I expected."

"No?"

"Three months ago, I thought my future was getting out of Oakdale as fast as possible. Going anywhere else, doing anything else. And now—" I looked out at the valley, at the patchwork of farms and fields I'd known my whole life. "Now I'm choosing to stay. To build a career here, doing work that matters here."

"Does that bother you? That you're staying?"

"No. That's the weird part. It doesn't." I tried to put it into words. "I'm not staying because I'm stuck or because I couldn't do anything else. I'm staying because this is where the work I want to do is. This is where I can make a difference."

"That's called finding your purpose."

"Is it?"

"It is." She leaned against me. "You're choosing Oakdale on your own terms. That's different from being trapped here."

She was right. The valley below didn't look like a cage anymore. It looked like a canvas—a place where I could build something meaningful, where my work could matter, where I could honor tradition while still innovating.

"What about you?" I asked. "Any updates on college plans?"

"I'm definitely applying to MIT. Also Carnegie Mellon, Georgia Tech, and CalTech. Engineering programs with good mechanical systems focuses." She said it matter-of-factly, the way she said most things. Like she'd made a decision and was following through.

"So probably not Georgia."

"Probably not. Georgia Tech is the backup if I want to stay closer." She looked at me carefully. "Does that bother you?"

It did. Of course it did. The thought of her being hundreds of miles away, building a life in a place I wasn't part of—it hurt. But it was also right. Her path, her choice.

"It bothers me," I said honestly. "But it doesn't change anything. You should go where's best for what you want to do. I'll figure out how to handle missing you."

"We'll figure it out together," Audrey corrected. "That's how this works."

"Letters and phone calls and visits when we're both home."

"And honesty about when it's working and when it's not. No pretending or forcing something that isn't sustainable just because we're afraid to lose it."

The practical approach to relationship maintenance. Very Audrey.

"I can do that," I said. "Honest, sustainable long distance built on mutual choice."

"Look at you, using relationship vocabulary."

"I'm learning."

We sat there as the afternoon stretched toward evening. Tomorrow the fair would end, the exhibitors would pack up, everyone would return to regular life. School would start next week. Fall would come. The seasons would turn.

But I had a plan now. Specific and concrete. Finish senior year while working part-time for Palmer Agricultural. Apply to agricultural science programs at state university. Continue developing the sustainable farming model for broader application. Work with my father on implementing test plots at the Turner farm.

And somewhere in there, maintain a relationship with a brilliant girl who'd be off at MIT or Carnegie Mellon doing her own important work.

All of it felt possible. Not easy, but possible.

That was enough.

"You know what I realized?" I said.

"What?"

"At the beginning of summer, when you asked what I wanted, I had no answer except 'not this.' I defined myself entirely by what I was against. But now when you ask what I want, I can tell you specifically. Agricultural innovation consulting. Modernizing family farms. Working with my father as partners. Building a career that lets me honor tradition while still pushing it forward. You."

"Me?"

"You. In whatever form that takes. Even if it's complicated and long distance and requires work. I want you in my life."

Audrey smiled, the real smile that lit up her whole face. "I want that too."

"So we're doing this."

"We're doing this."

Below us, the fair began its evening transformation—lights coming on, the carnival rides glowing against the darkening sky, families gathering for the last night's festivities. Music drifted up from the main stage. The smell of fried food and summer heat hung in the air.

It was all familiar. I'd been coming to this fair my whole life, watched it from this same vantage point countless times.

But tonight it looked different. Or maybe I was different, and that changed how I saw everything else.

Not trapped. Not desperate to escape. Just—choosing. Choosing to be here, to build a life here, to find meaning in the work that mattered to me.

The future wasn't some vague escape plan anymore. It was specific. Detailed. A path I could walk with intention instead of just running from what I didn't want.

Agricultural consulting. University coursework. Partnership with my father. Relationship with Audrey despite distance. Work that honored tradition while innovating.

All of it clear. All of it mine.

"We should head back down," Audrey said. "Fair closes soon."

"Yeah."

But we sat there a few minutes longer, watching the valley settle into evening, the Turner farm visible in the distance—solid and permanent and waiting for tomorrow when I'd start actually implementing the changes I'd proposed.

My farm. My choice. My future.

Specific, concrete, and entirely mine.

That was everything.
