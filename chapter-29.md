# Chapter 29: Foundations and Beginnings

Monday morning, I showed up for farm work at six.

Not because my father expected it—though he did. Not because I had to prove something—though part of me still wanted to. But because this was my farm now too, my responsibility, my choice to be here.

Marcus was already in the south field, checking the irrigation system we'd be replacing with the pivot setup from my proposal. He looked up when my truck pulled in, and something that might have been a smile crossed his face.

"On time," he said.

"Thought we had planning to do."

"We do. But work comes first. Always does."

We spent the morning doing the regular maintenance—checking equipment, assessing the cotton for signs of boll weevil damage, running water lines to the far acres. Normal farm work. The kind I'd resented for years because it felt like obligation without purpose.

Now it felt different. Like laying foundation. The necessary work that had to happen before you could build anything else.

Around ten, we took a break in the barn—the same barn where I'd worked on my proposal for weeks, where my father had first dismissed it, where everything had shifted.

Marcus spread my proposal out on the workbench. Not the display version from the fair, but the working copy I'd been annotating with implementation notes.

"Talk me through it," he said. "Not the presentation version. The real version. What would actually work on this farm, this year, with our resources?"

So I did.

We went through every element of the proposal together. Marcus asked practical questions I hadn't fully answered—what happens if we get a drought during the crop rotation transition, how do we handle the labor requirements during pivot irrigation installation, what's the backup plan if yields drop in year one.

Not dismissive questions. Genuine ones. The questions of someone taking this seriously.

I answered what I could, admitted where I didn't have complete solutions, suggested ways we could pilot test uncertain elements before committing the whole farm.

"The cover crop program," Marcus said, tapping that section. "This could work. Start with fifty acres in the north field after this harvest. See how it performs over winter."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. Low risk, potentially high reward. Worth testing." He made a note in the margin. "And the crop rotation—we can't overhaul everything in one season, but we could start phasing it in. Ten-year transition timeline instead of trying to do it all at once."

We worked through lunch, my brother joining us when he finished his own morning tasks. He had questions too, mostly about how the changes would affect labor distribution and whether we'd need to hire extra help during transition periods.

"Could work," he said, echoing our father. "If we phase it carefully."

Beth brought sandwiches out to the barn around one, found us surrounded by papers and diagrams and timelines. She looked at the three Turner men actually working together and actually smiled.

"Well this is different," she said.

"Wade's got good ideas," Marcus said. "We're figuring out how to implement them."

"Some of them," I corrected. "The realistic ones."

"That's growth right there," Beth said. "Acknowledging limits."

After she left, we kept working. By mid-afternoon, we had a real plan. Not the whole proposal—some elements were too expensive or complex for our current operation. But a genuine implementation timeline for the next eighteen months. Test plots for cover crops. Phased crop rotation beginning next spring. Budget allocated for pivot irrigation system installation over winter.

Real changes. Actual innovation. My ideas becoming reality.

"This is good work," Marcus said finally, sitting back. "Real good work."

"Thanks."

"Means you're committed though. To being here, doing this work. Can't start something like this and walk away when it gets hard."

"I know."

"Do you? Because this isn't a summer project anymore. This is the next few years of the farm's direction. That's serious."

I met his eyes. "I'm serious. I'm here. Not because I couldn't do anything else, but because this is what I want to do."

He studied me for a long moment, then nodded. "Okay then. Partners."

"Partners," I agreed.

He held out his hand. We shook on it—firm, solid, meaningful. Not father and disappointing son. Partners with mutual respect.

That evening, the whole Turner family sat down for dinner together.

It was awkward at first. We weren't used to peace. Weren't sure how to navigate conversation without conflict. But slowly, it happened. Marcus talked about the implementation plan. My brother discussed equipment maintenance schedules. Beth shared news about church and community events.

And me—I talked about the consulting job offer from Palmer Agricultural, about college plans, about agricultural science programs.

"You're really thinking university?" Marcus asked.

"Yeah. Agricultural science, specifically. Learn the technical side so I can do this work properly."

"That's good. Smart." He took a drink of water. "Your great-grandfather—my grandfather—he would have loved this. Seeing a Turner go to university to learn farming. He always said education and experience together made the best farmers."

It was the first time my father had mentioned his grandfather in years. The family history, the legacy, offered not as obligation but as connection.

"The extension program offers scholarships," I said. "For Georgia kids going into agricultural science. I'm applying."

"You'll get it," my brother said confidently. "After that fair presentation? They'd be stupid not to give it to you."

We ate dinner together like a normal family. Passed dishes. Talked about plans and weather and the small details of daily life. The house felt different than it had since my mother died—warmer, lighter, like something that had been broken was finally starting to heal.

After dinner, I helped wash dishes again. Marcus dried while I washed, the two of us working in comfortable silence.

"Your mother would be proud," he said quietly, echoing what he'd said at the fair. "Of who you're becoming."

"I wish she could have seen it."

"She knew. Even when you were twelve and angry at the world, she knew you had this in you. She used to tell me to be patient, that you'd find your way when you were ready." He set a plate in the drying rack. "I should have listened better."

"We both made mistakes."

"Yeah. But we're fixing them now. That's what matters."

After the kitchen was clean, I headed out to the barn. Not to work, just to be there. The space where so much had shifted over the summer felt different now. Not a hiding place or workshop, but just—part of the farm. Part of home.

My proposal materials were still spread out on the workbench, now annotated with my father's handwriting alongside mine. Partnership made visible.

I pulled out my phone and texted Audrey: "Started implementation planning with my dad today. Actually working together."

Her response came quickly: "How does it feel?"

"Like building something real," I wrote back. "Like foundation."

"Good. You earned this."

I sat there in the barn as evening settled in, thinking about how much had changed. Three months ago, I'd been in this exact spot, angry and lost and desperate for any escape. Now I was choosing to stay, choosing to build, choosing to be part of something bigger than my own restlessness.

The work ahead wouldn't be easy. Implementing the sustainable farming practices would take years. College would be challenging. Maintaining a relationship with Audrey across distance would require constant effort. None of it was simple or guaranteed.

But it was mine. Built on a foundation I'd chosen, work I believed in, relationships I'd fought for.

That made all the difference.

I heard footsteps and looked up to find my father in the barn doorway.

"Wanted to make sure you saw this," he said, handing me a piece of paper.

It was a check. Made out to me. The amount made my eyes widen.

"What's this?"

"Fair winnings. Second place gets five hundred dollars." He shrugged. "Your prize. Figured you could put it toward college applications or equipment or whatever you need."

Five hundred dollars. Real money for real achievement.

"Thanks," I managed.

"You earned it." He paused at the doorway. "I'm proud of you, Wade. Want to make sure I say that enough since I didn't say it for so long."

After he left, I sat there holding the check, feeling the weight of everything it represented. Not just money, but validation. Recognition. My father's pride made tangible.

But more than that—proof that I'd built something real. That the work I'd done mattered beyond my own internal satisfaction. That choosing forward had consequences, good ones, ones that opened doors I hadn't even known existed.

Tomorrow, school would start. Senior year, with all its demands and deadlines. The consulting work with Palmer Agricultural would begin. College applications would need attention. The farm implementation would continue.

All of it felt manageable. Not because it would be easy, but because I finally had a foundation I believed in. Internal validation, external support, and clear direction forward.

I'd spent years fighting against everything. Now I was fighting for something—for my future, for the farm, for the work that mattered to me.

That was real rebellion. That was real courage.

And it was just beginning.
