# Chapter 24: Recognition

Saturday morning, the fairgrounds were packed.

I'd barely slept Friday night, replaying the day in my head. The conversations, the questions, the professional interest from Mr. Palmer's colleagues. Ray's mockery and my calm response. My father's careful examination of my work, that single nod.

I kept trying not to hope. Kept reminding myself that I'd done this for me, that external validation wasn't the foundation. But hope crept in anyway, persistent and cautious.

The agricultural innovation category announcement was scheduled for noon. I got to my booth early, straightened displays that didn't need straightening, reorganized materials that were already organized. Nervous energy had nowhere to go.

"You're going to wear a hole in the ground," Audrey said, appearing with two cups of lemonade.

"I'm fine."

"You're pacing."

I stopped pacing. Took the lemonade. "What if it's not good enough?"

"Then it's not good enough. But you'll have still done the work. Still learned what you're capable of. Still chosen your path." She touched my arm lightly. "The outcome doesn't change what you've already accomplished."

I knew she was right. Didn't make the waiting easier.

At eleven-thirty, fair officials started setting up the presentation area—a small stage with microphone, chairs arranged in rows for audience members. The innovation category was one of the bigger draws, especially for the farming families who made up the fair's core community.

People began gathering. Farmers I recognized, some I didn't. Agricultural extension agents with clipboards. Mr. Palmer and his colleagues. Even some townspeople who didn't farm but came out of curiosity or community support.

My father and brother sat in the back row. Beth was with them, looking proud already. Marcus's expression was carefully neutral, but he was here. That mattered.

Tommy grabbed a seat up front, gave me a thumbs up.

Diane waved from the side.

"Ladies and gentlemen," the announcer began. "Welcome to this year's Agricultural Innovation Competition. We had fifteen excellent entries showcasing the future of Georgia farming..."

The words washed over me. He talked about the importance of innovation, of young people engaging with agriculture's challenges, of balancing tradition with progress. Then he started naming the finalists.

"...Johnson's integrated pest management system..."

Not me. That was okay. Still four more spots.

"...Martinez's precision soil monitoring technology..."

Three more.

"...And Turner's sustainable farming practices for small family farms."

My heart stopped.

I was a finalist.

Audrey squeezed my hand hard. Tommy let out a whoop that got him looks from the more dignified attendees. I sat frozen, trying to process.

Finalist. They'd chosen my project as one of the top five out of fifteen entries.

"Finalists will now give brief presentations," the announcer continued. "Five minutes each, followed by judge questions."

My mind went blank. I had to present. Right now. In front of all these people.

Including my father.

---

I went third.

The first two presenters were good—polished, professional, clearly experienced with public speaking. They had technical innovations with impressive data, backing from universities or agricultural companies.

I was a seventeen-year-old kid with six weeks of research and a dream about saving family farms.

But when they called my name, I stood up. Walked to the microphone. Looked out at the audience.

And remembered why I'd done this.

"My name is Wade Turner," I started. "I'm a fourth-generation farmer on my family's cotton and tobacco operation here in Oakdale. Like a lot of family farms, we're facing challenges—water scarcity, soil depletion, rising costs, climate uncertainty. The traditional methods that worked for my great-grandfather don't address these new realities."

I clicked to my first slide—the crop rotation diagram.

"But I believe we don't have to choose between honoring our farming heritage and adapting to current challenges. This proposal integrates traditional farming wisdom with modern sustainable practices, specifically designed for small family operations between 200-400 acres."

I walked them through it. The crop rotation cycle that improved soil health while maintaining cash crop yields. The pivot irrigation system that cut water usage in half while actually increasing efficiency. The cover crop program that prevented erosion and restored nutrients organically.

I explained the cost-benefit analysis, the implementation timeline, the expected outcomes. I talked about preserving family farming as a way of life while making it viable for the next generation.

I spoke clearly, confidently, answering technical questions without hesitation. Because I knew this material. I'd lived with it for six weeks, refined it, tested it against every objection I could imagine.

This wasn't theory. This was a real plan for the real farm I'd grown up on.

And I believed in it.

When I finished, there was a beat of silence. Then applause—genuine, sustained. Not polite audience applause but the kind that came from people who understood what I was trying to do and respected the effort.

I caught my father's eye. He wasn't clapping—too reserved for that—but his expression had shifted. Pride, maybe. Or at least acknowledgment that his son had just stood up there and held his own among people with far more experience and resources.

The judges asked questions. Practical ones about implementation challenges, about scalability, about dealing with variables I couldn't control. I answered honestly—acknowledged where I didn't have all the solutions, explained my reasoning where I did, demonstrated that I'd thought this through seriously.

By the time I returned to my seat, I was shaking with adrenaline and relief.

I'd done it. Presented my work to the whole county. Held my own.

Whatever happened next, I'd done that part.

---

The remaining presenters went. A precision agriculture system using drones and sensors. A water reclamation project for irrigation. Both impressive, both backed by substantial resources and expertise.

Then came deliberation. The judges—three agricultural extension agents, two university professors, and a representative from the state farming commission—conferred while everyone waited with varying degrees of patience.

Fifteen minutes felt like hours.

Finally, they returned to the stage.

"This was an exceptional group of projects," the head judge said. "The quality and thoughtfulness of this year's innovation entries exceeded our expectations. Every finalist should be proud of the work they've presented."

The preamble that preceded announcing winners. I braced myself.

"Third place goes to the precision soil monitoring technology presented by Miguel Martinez."

Applause. Miguel accepted his ribbon and certificate, smiling.

"Second place—" The judge paused, and my stomach clenched. "Goes to Sustainable Farming Practices for Small Family Farms, presented by Wade Turner."

Second place.

Not first. But second. Out of fifteen entries. Recognized. Validated. Taken seriously.

I stood on shaking legs and made my way to the stage. The judge shook my hand, handed me a blue ribbon and certificate, said something I didn't quite hear over the rushing in my ears.

The audience applauded. Tommy whistled. Diane was actually crying, which seemed excessive but touched me anyway.

And my father—my father was standing. Clapping. Not exuberantly, but genuinely. His expression said what he'd never been good at saying with words: Well done.

After the ceremony, people swarmed the finalists. Farmers wanting more information, agricultural agents discussing implementation support, even a few reporters from local papers covering the fair.

A woman from the state agricultural extension pulled me aside. "We'd like to include your proposal in our resource materials for small farm modernization. With your permission, of course."

"Yes. Absolutely."

"And we have a partnership program with the state university—we identify promising young people interested in agricultural science and help facilitate college admissions and scholarship applications. Would you be interested?"

College. Agricultural science. A path forward.

"Very interested," I said.

She handed me her card, told me to contact her in September, and moved on to the other finalists.

Mr. Palmer appeared with his colleagues in tow.

"Wade, I'd like you to meet David Chen, our regional director. We've been discussing your project and its applications for other family farms."

We talked for twenty minutes about potential partnerships, about my senior year and college plans, about the future of sustainable agriculture. They treated me not like a kid with a school project but like someone with valuable ideas worth implementing.

It was surreal and wonderful and terrifying all at once.

---

Eventually the crowd thinned. Audrey had been giving me space, letting me handle the professional conversations, but now she appeared at my elbow.

"Second place," she said, grinning. "Not bad for someone who didn't even know what he wanted six weeks ago."

"Not bad," I agreed.

"I'm proud of you."

"Thanks. But—" I remembered what she'd taught me. "I'm proud of myself too."

Her smile widened. "Look at you, internalizing growth."

"I have a good teacher."

"You did the work yourself, Wade. All of it."

Maybe. But she'd asked the questions that made me examine what I was doing and why. That had made all the difference.

Tommy bounded over, nearly tackling me with enthusiasm. "Dude! Second place! Your actual face when they announced it—I wish I'd gotten a picture."

"I was surprised."

"You were shocked. But you killed that presentation. Even the first-place guy wasn't as good as you."

"He had drone technology."

"You had passion. And actual knowledge. That matters more."

We stood there grinning at each other like idiots until my brother appeared.

"Not bad, little brother," he said, clapping me on the shoulder. "Real solid work."

"Thanks."

"Dad wants to talk to you. He's over by the livestock barn."

My stomach flipped. "Okay."

Audrey squeezed my hand. "Go. I'll be here when you're done."

I made my way through the thinning crowd, past the exhibition tents and food stalls, to where the livestock barn stood solid against the afternoon sky.

My father waited there, leaning against a fence rail, watching the 4-H kids prep their animals for evening judging.

He turned when I approached.

For a long moment, we just looked at each other. A summer's worth of hard conversations and harder silences stretched between us. Years of disappointment and misunderstanding and failed attempts at connection.

And then my father said three words I'd been waiting my whole life to hear.

"I was wrong."
