# Chapter 17: The Relapse

It was a bad week. The kind where everything that could go wrong did, and the universe seemed personally invested in reminding me exactly who I was.

Monday, I tried talking to my father about crop rotation again—came armed with articles from the agricultural journals Mr. Palmer had lent me, specific numbers about yield improvement. Marcus listened for about thirty seconds before cutting me off.

"Wade, I don't have time for theoretical nonsense. The south field needs plowing, and you're standing here with magazine articles." He walked away before I could respond, leaving me holding papers that suddenly felt like toys. Kid stuff. Proof I didn't understand real work.

Tuesday, my English teacher handed back essays with that same surprised look she'd been wearing for weeks—like she couldn't quite believe I'd actually done the assignment. "Much better, Wade. You're really applying yourself." But her tone suggested she was waiting for the other shoe to drop, for me to go back to being the student who turned in half-finished work or nothing at all.

I wanted to tell her I'd always been capable of this. The difference was I'd started caring. But the words stuck in my throat.

Wednesday, Ray Coleman caught me coming out of the feed store and started in on his usual commentary. How long was I planning to keep up the good boy act? Did Audrey know she was dating Oakdale's biggest screwup? Wasn't I getting tired of pretending to be someone I wasn't?

I walked away. Again. My hands shook the whole drive home.

Thursday, I overheard two teachers in the hallway discussing whether to let me into the agriculture club. One thought I deserved a chance. The other said I'd just cause trouble or quit when it got boring, same as everything else.

By Friday afternoon, I felt like I was suffocating. Every conversation required translation. Every interaction was a test. Every moment demanded I prove I wasn't who everyone knew I was, except I wasn't sure anymore who that was supposed to be.

When Audrey found me after school, leaning against my truck in the parking lot, I must have looked as wrung out as I felt.

"Hey," she said, touching my arm gently. "You okay?"

"I need some space," I said. The words came out harder than I meant them. "Not from you. Just from—" I gestured vaguely at the school, the town, the whole damn world pressing in. "From trying so hard all the time."

Her expression shifted—not hurt, but worried. "Wade—"

"Just for tonight. I need to not think for a few hours."

She studied my face, and I knew she saw more than I wanted her to. But she nodded. "Okay. Call me tomorrow?"

"Yeah."

She squeezed my hand and walked to her car. I watched her drive away and felt something loosen in my chest. Relief, maybe. Or permission to stop holding myself together.

The drag strip looked the same as it always had—dirt road stretching into darkness, cars lined up like racehors at a starting gate, guys drinking and laughing and not giving a damn about tomorrow. The familiarity hit me like coming home after a long trip.

"Wade!" Billy Dawson called out, waving a bottle. "Thought you'd gone soft on us."

"Just busy," I said, making my way through the crowd.

Tommy was there, leaning against his truck with a concerned expression I pretended not to notice. "You racing tonight?"

"That's the plan."

"Audrey know you're here?"

"She knows I needed space." I didn't elaborate. Didn't want to examine too closely why I'd needed space from trying to be better and ended up exactly here.

The first race was against some kid from the next county. I barely knew him, didn't care about him. Just wanted the rush of acceleration, the roar of the engine, the simplicity of foot on gas and eyes on road. No thinking. No performing. Just speed.

I won easily. The familiar satisfaction flooded through me—uncomplicated, clean. This I was good at. This I'd always been good at.

"Hell yeah!" Billy appeared with the bottle again. "One more?"

I took it. The liquor burned going down, sharp and mean, but it dulled the edges of the week. Made the scrutiny feel farther away. Made the questions about who I was and who I was pretending to be seem less urgent.

One drink became three. Tommy tried to slow me down, but I brushed him off. I wasn't drunk—I knew my limits—but I was loose. Relaxed. Not thinking.

Not thinking felt incredible.

I raced twice more, won both times, drove too fast and too reckless and didn't care. This was what I'd been missing. Not the racing itself but the freedom of it. The not caring. The not trying.

The not disappointing anyone because they already expected the worst.

Around eleven, some guys from Oakdale showed up. Friends of Ray's, wearing matching sneers. They set up on the other side of the strip, making comments just loud enough to carry.

"Turner's back. Guess the reformation didn't stick."

"City girl probably got smart and dumped him."

"Nah, she just figured out what everyone already knew—"

I kept my distance. Didn't engage. I could feel Tommy watching me, worried I'd do something stupid.

Then I heard her name.

"—bet that Palmer girl's real sweet. Shame she's wasting herself on Turner. Maybe when he screws it up, she'll want a real man—"

I was moving before I thought about it. Crossed the strip in five strides, grabbed the guy by his shirt, and slammed him against his car.

"Say her name again," I said quietly. "I dare you."

His friends moved closer. Tommy appeared at my shoulder, along with Billy and a couple others. The night crystallized into that familiar pre-fight tension—everyone waiting to see who'd throw the first punch.

"Wade, he's not worth it," Tommy said.

But he was wrong. Or maybe he was right and I just didn't care anymore.

The guy smirked. "Touchy, aren't we? What's the matter, Turner? Truth hurt?"

My fist connected with his jaw before he finished the sentence.

After that, it was chaos. Fists and shouting and the sharp pain of knuckles on bone. Someone grabbed me from behind. I twisted free, swung again. Tasted blood—mine or his, I couldn't tell. Didn't care.

This was easier. This was simple. This was honest.

Someone pulled us apart eventually. The guy was bleeding from his nose, cursing. My knuckles were split, shirt torn. Tommy had me by the arm, practically dragging me to my truck.

"Get out of here before the sheriff shows up," he said.

I drove home too fast, windows down, radio off. The silence roared in my ears. My hands were shaking on the wheel—from adrenaline or shame, I couldn't tell. Maybe both.

The farm was dark when I pulled in. I cut the engine and sat in the driveway, breathing hard. My knuckles throbbed. My jaw ached where someone had landed a hit. I could smell liquor and dust and blood.

Same as it ever was.

My bedroom was exactly like I'd left it that morning. Bed made neat because my father expected it. Dresser clear except for the stack of agricultural journals Mr. Palmer had lent me. Desk covered in notes about sustainable farming practices, crop rotation cycles, soil conservation.

Evidence of the person I'd been trying to become.

I looked down at my split knuckles. Evidence of the person I'd always been.

It had been so easy to slide back. One bad week, one moment of frustration, and here I was—drunk and bloody and no different than I'd been three months ago. All that trying, all that effort, and it took less than three hours to undo it.

Everyone had been right to doubt me. Ray, the church ladies, the teachers, Tommy. They'd all known it was just a matter of time before I proved them right.

I sat on the edge of my bed, still in my torn shirt, and tried to figure out what hurt worse—my knuckles or the shame crawling up my throat.

The journals on my desk caught my eye. Articles about innovation and tradition, about modernizing family farms, about building something sustainable. I'd read them all twice, taken notes, started planning. Started hoping.

Started believing I could be someone different.

But maybe that was the problem. Maybe I'd been performing the whole time—trying on a costume that didn't fit, pretending I could change because Audrey made me want to. Tommy had asked if I was changing for her or for myself, and I'd said for myself, but sitting here now with blood drying on my knuckles, I didn't know anymore.

Maybe you couldn't change who you fundamentally were. Maybe all the trying in the world didn't matter if the core of you was rotten.

My father always said a bad tree can't bear good fruit. I'd thought he was wrong, thought I could prove him wrong. But tonight I'd proven him right instead.

I lay back on my bed without bothering to clean up or change clothes. The ceiling fan turned slow circles overhead, same as it had every night of my life. Outside, crickets sang. The farm settled into familiar nighttime sounds.

And I wondered if I had it in me to keep trying. To get up tomorrow and face all those watching eyes again, knowing how easy it was to slip back into old patterns. Knowing how much effort it took to be different, how constant the vigilance had to be.

Knowing I might not be strong enough.

The last thought I had before sleep took me was of Audrey's face when I'd asked for space. That worried expression. Like she'd known exactly where I'd end up.

Like she'd been waiting for this all along.

Like everyone else.
