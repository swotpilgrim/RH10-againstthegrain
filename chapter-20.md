# Chapter 20: The Crisis Point

The flyer was tacked to the bulletin board at the feed store, same as it was every year: County Agriculture Fair, August 28-30. Livestock competitions, produce displays, and—in smaller print at the bottom—Agricultural Innovation Category.

I stood there staring at it for a long minute, people moving around me, until the decision crystallized.

Four weeks. I had four weeks.

---

I started that night.

The barn became my workshop after everyone else had gone to bed. I spread out everything I'd collected over the past weeks—the agricultural journals Mr. Palmer had lent me, articles about sustainable farming practices, notes from conversations about soil conservation and water management. The bare bones of an idea I'd been circling around without committing to.

Now I committed.

The proposal took shape slowly, methodically. I focused it specifically on the Turner farm—our three hundred acres, our crops, our challenges with water and soil depletion. Not theoretical ideas but practical applications. Crop rotation cycles that would improve soil health while maintaining cotton and tobacco yields. Water conservation techniques using pivot irrigation that would cut usage in half. Cover crops to prevent erosion and restore nutrients.

I worked until two, three in the morning, filling pages with calculations and diagrams. When I finally slept, I dreamed in percentages and growing seasons.

During the day, I kept up with regular farm work—my father would notice if I slacked off. But every spare moment, I was back in the barn with my proposal. Mr. Palmer helped during his evening visits to discuss equipment needs with my father. He'd linger afterward, review my cost-benefit analyses, suggest refinements to the presentation.

"This is solid work, Wade," he said one evening, studying my water conservation calculations. "Really solid. Have you shown your father?"

"Not yet." I kept my eyes on the page I was writing. "I want to finish it first."

What I didn't say: I wanted it to be perfect before he saw it. Wanted it to be so good he couldn't dismiss it. Couldn't dismiss me.

At school, when we started back after summer break, I actually paid attention in agriculture class. Asked questions. Took notes that I incorporated into my proposal. Tommy watched with increasing bewilderment.

"You're really doing this," he said one afternoon.

"Yeah."

"Why?"

Good question. I'd been asking myself the same thing every night as I worked alone in the barn. Not for Audrey—she supported me but this wasn't about her. Not to prove Ray wrong, though that would be satisfying. Not even, I was starting to realize, for my father's approval.

I was doing it because the work mattered to me. Because I'd found something I was good at that actually meant something. Because for the first time, I could see a future I wanted instead of just a past I was running from.

"Because I want to," I told Tommy. Simple as that.

Three weeks into my project, word got around. Oakdale being Oakdale, secrets didn't last long. Someone saw the light on in the Turner barn late at night. Someone else heard Mr. Palmer talking about Wade's impressive proposal at the diner. The pieces came together.

Ray Coleman, naturally, had opinions about it.

I was loading supplies at the hardware store when he found me, flanked by two of his buddies. They blocked my path to my truck, wearing matching smirks.

"Heard you're entering the fair," Ray said. "Agricultural innovation category. That's real cute, Wade."

I kept loading. "Ray."

"What is it, some little school project? Trying to impress your daddy with book learning?" He laughed, and his friends joined in. "That's pathetic, man. You've spent years spitting on everything farming stands for, and now you're desperate enough to pretend you care?"

"I do care."

"Please. This is all show. For that city girl, probably. Does she think it's charming, you playing farmer?"

My jaw tightened, but I kept my voice level. "You don't know what you're talking about."

"I know you," Ray said, stepping closer. "I know guys like you. You think if you clean up and smile pretty, people will forget who you really are. But they won't, Turner. A week after this fair's over, you'll be back at the drag strip, back in fights, back to being the disappointment everyone knows you are. This whole thing?" He gestured dismissively. "It's just noise. You trying to convince yourself you're better than you are."

The words hit harder than they should have. Maybe because part of me wondered the same thing. But I didn't take the bait.

"Thanks for your opinion, Ray. I'll give it all the consideration it deserves."

I finished loading and drove away, his laughter following me down Main Street.

Two days before the fair deadline, my proposal was done.

Thirty pages of detailed analysis, implementation timelines, cost projections, and expected outcomes. Charts showing water usage reduction. Diagrams of crop rotation cycles. A comprehensive plan for modernizing the Turner farm while honoring three generations of farming tradition.

It was good. Better than good. It was the best work I'd ever done.

I should have been proud. I was proud. But underneath the satisfaction was a trembling hope I couldn't quite suppress: maybe my father would see it. Maybe he'd understand. Maybe this would be the thing that finally bridged the gap between us.

I was in the barn organizing my materials into presentation folders when I heard footsteps.

Marcus filled the doorway, backlit by the late afternoon sun. I hadn't heard his truck, hadn't expected him back from town for another hour.

"Heard you've been spending a lot of time out here," he said.

My heart kicked into high gear. "Yeah. Working on a project."

He stepped inside, and I saw his eyes land on the papers spread across the workbench. The title page: Sustainable Farming Practices for the Turner Farm—A Proposal for Agricultural Innovation.

"What's all this?"

This was it. The moment I'd been working toward and dreading in equal measure.

"It's for the county fair. The agriculture innovation category." I moved to stand next to the workbench, gesturing at the proposal. "I've been researching sustainable farming practices—ways to modernize without losing what makes family farming work. This whole thing is specific to our farm. Our acreage, our crops, our challenges."

Marcus picked up the title page, started flipping through. I held my breath.

He read slowly, carefully. Studied the charts. Examined the crop rotation diagrams. His expression gave nothing away.

I waited. Each second stretched out painfully long.

"See, I've been looking at water conservation," I said, unable to stand the silence. "We could cut our irrigation costs almost in half with a pivot system, and the efficiency would actually improve yield because—"

"Wade." Marcus set the papers down. His voice was flat.

I stopped talking.

"This is exactly the problem," he said.

The words felt like a gut punch.

"What?"

"You've always got some idea. Some theory from a book or a magazine. Some new way to do things that sounds real good on paper." He tapped the proposal with one finger. "But farming isn't about fancy plans, Wade. It's about showing up every single day and doing the actual work. Getting your hands dirty. Not sitting in a barn making charts."

"But the research—"

"Research doesn't plant crops. Research doesn't fix equipment when it breaks down at four in the morning during harvest. Research doesn't get you through a drought or a bad season." His voice wasn't angry. That would have been easier. It was just disappointed. Tired.

"I know that," I said. "That's why this proposal is practical. It's not just theory—look at the implementation timeline, the cost analysis. I've accounted for—"

"You've accounted for everything except the thousand things you can't account for. That's what experience teaches you, son. That's what you'd know if you'd been paying attention instead of fighting this place for the last five years."

Son. He called me son when he was trying to be patient, trying to explain something I should already understand.

"This could work," I said. My voice came out smaller than I wanted. "If you'd just look at it seriously—"

"I did look at it. And I'm telling you it's the same thing it's always been with you—you'd rather dream about doing something different than actually do the work that's in front of you."

He turned to leave, pausing at the barn door.

"When you're ready to take farming seriously—actually seriously, not just playing at it with proposals and ideas—you know where to find me."

Then he was gone.

I stood there staring at the proposal he'd left on the workbench. Thirty pages of my best work. The most serious I'd ever been about anything. And he'd looked at it for five minutes and dismissed it.

Dismissed me.

My hands were shaking. I sat down hard on the overturned crate I used as a stool, trying to process what had just happened.

I'd done everything right this time. Worked hard. Did real research. Created something practical and specific. I'd committed, genuinely committed, for the first time in my life.

And it still wasn't enough.

The realization settled into my bones like cold rain. Maybe Ray was right. Maybe I was just fooling myself, playing at being someone I wasn't. My father had seen through it in five minutes. Seen right past all my work to the same disappointment underneath.

Nothing had changed. I could work myself to exhaustion, could do everything differently, could want it as hard as I was capable of wanting anything, and I'd still be the screwup Wade Turner. The disappointment. The one who didn't understand real work.

I looked around the barn—at the journals stacked neatly on the shelf, at my tools organized for the first time in years, at the proposal that represented weeks of effort and hope.

All of it meaningless. All of it just more evidence that trying didn't matter if you were fundamentally wrong.

The sun was setting, painting the barn in long orange light. In the house, my father would be having dinner, satisfied that he'd set his foolish son straight once again.

And I was alone in the barn, looking at the ruins of the best attempt I'd ever made.

Wondering if I had it in me to keep trying when trying changed nothing.
