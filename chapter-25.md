# Chapter 25: His Father's Son

"I was wrong."

The words hung in the late afternoon air between us, so unexpected I wasn't sure I'd heard them correctly.

"What?"

My father pushed off from the fence rail, hands in his pockets. He looked uncomfortable in a way I'd rarely seen—not angry or disappointed, but uncertain. Vulnerable.

"About you," he said. "About what you were doing. I was wrong."

I couldn't speak. Couldn't process. My father didn't admit to being wrong. Not about farming, not about me, not about anything. That's not how Marcus Turner worked.

"I assumed—" He stopped, started again. "When you started pushing back against farming, against the life I'd planned for you, I took it personally. Thought it meant you were disrespecting everything I'd built. Everything your grandfather and great-grandfather built."

A kid ran past us chasing a runaway chicken, breaking the moment. We both watched until the chicken was caught, giving us an excuse not to look at each other.

"I didn't understand," Marcus continued, "that you weren't rejecting farming itself. You were trying to find your own way to engage with it. Your own path that honored the tradition while making it yours."

"I didn't know that either," I admitted. "Not at first. I just knew I felt trapped."

"I made you feel that way. By insisting it had to be done exactly how I did it, how my father did it. By not listening when you tried to talk about different approaches." He finally looked at me. "That presentation today—Wade, that was real work. Thoughtful, serious work. And I dismissed it when I first saw it because I was so used to seeing you as the problem instead of seeing what you were actually trying to do."

My throat was tight. "You read it again though. Really read it."

"I did. And I saw—" He paused, choosing words carefully. "I saw someone who understands farming at a level I didn't give you credit for. Someone who's thought deeply about how to preserve what matters while adapting to new challenges. Someone who cares."

"I do care," I said quietly. "I always did. I just didn't know how to show it in a way you could see."

"That's on me, not you. I should have looked harder. Should have asked more questions instead of just being disappointed that you weren't following the path I'd laid out."

We stood in silence for a minute. Around us, the fair continued—laughter and carnival music and the low of cattle. The sounds of late summer in Georgia, familiar as breathing.

"Your proposal has real merit," Marcus said. "Especially the crop rotation schedule and the water conservation system. Some of the implementation costs are higher than we could probably handle, but the core ideas—those could work. On the Turner farm specifically."

"You think so?"

"I know so. That's what I've been thinking about since I read it properly. How we could actually do this. Together."

Together.

The word settled into my chest like something solid and warm.

"If you're still interested," Marcus continued, "I'd like to try implementing some of your proposals. Start small—test plots, pilot programs. Prove the concepts before we commit the whole farm. But if they work—" He met my eyes. "If they work, we could be doing something real here. Modernizing the Turner farm while keeping it the Turner farm."

"I'm interested," I said. Could barely get the words out past the emotion clogging my throat. "I want that. To work with you. To build something together."

"It won't be easy. We'll disagree. We're both too stubborn for it to go smoothly."

"I know."

"But we can disagree productively. Like adults. Like partners instead of—" He gestured vaguely at the years of conflict between us.

"Like partners," I agreed. "Not authority and rebellion."

"Exactly." Something that might have been a smile crossed his face. "You got second place. Out of fifteen entries. Projects from people with more experience and resources than you. That's not nothing, Wade."

"It felt like everything."

"It should. You earned it." He pulled his hands from his pockets, crossed his arms instead. Still Marcus Turner, still uncomfortable with overt emotion. But trying. "I'm proud of you. Should have said that right away instead of making this into a whole speech."

I'm proud of you.

The words I'd been chasing my whole life, the validation I'd desperately wanted and told myself I didn't need. Hearing them now, standing in the livestock barn with fair sounds surrounding us, felt different than I'd imagined.

Better. Because they were earned. Because I'd done real work that deserved recognition. Because my father had seen me—really seen me—and found something worth being proud of.

"Thanks," I managed.

"You know what struck me most about your presentation?" Marcus asked.

"What?"

"You talked about preserving family farming as a way of life. About making it viable for the next generation." He looked at me steadily. "That means you're planning to stay. To be that next generation."

I nodded. "If you'll have me."

"Son, I've been waiting for you to want this. Really want it, not just accept it because it's expected. Today I saw you fighting for it. That made all the difference."

Son. Not the disappointed, patient son from before. Just son. His son. The one he was proud of.

"I should have told you sooner," Marcus said, "that farming doesn't have to look the way it did for me. Or my father. That every generation has to figure out how to make it work in their own context. Your way isn't wrong just because it's different from mine."

"Took me a while to figure out my way wasn't wrong either."

"Well. We're both learning, I guess." He shifted his weight, clearly ready to end this unprecedented emotional conversation but not sure how. "Your mother would have been proud too. Of the man you're becoming. She always said you had it in you to do something meaningful. She'd have loved that presentation."

The mention of my mother—rare, painful, significant—nearly undid me.

"She'd have made you listen to me sooner," I said, trying for lightness.

"She would have. She was better at the communication part. At seeing what people needed." His expression softened with old grief. "I retreated into work after she died. Left you alone when you needed support. I know that. I'm sorry for it."

"I didn't make it easy."

"You were twelve and grieving. It wasn't your job to make it easy. It was my job to be there anyway." He met my eyes. "I'm here now. If you'll let me be."

"Yeah," I said. "I'd like that."

We stood there awkwardly, the emotional heaviness between us needing some kind of resolution we didn't quite know how to create. Marcus wasn't a hugger. Neither was I, really. We didn't do overt displays of affection.

But he held out his hand.

I shook it—firm, solid, meaningful. A handshake that meant partnership. Respect. A new beginning built on mutual understanding instead of disappointed expectations.

"So," Marcus said, releasing my hand. "Monday morning. We'll sit down with your proposal and start planning which elements we can implement first. Draw up a real timeline, budget it out properly, figure out the logistics."

"Monday morning," I agreed. "I'll be ready."

"I know you will." He started to walk away, then turned back. "Wade?"

"Yeah?"

"That girl. Audrey. She's good for you. Helped you see yourself clearly, from what I can tell."

I blinked, surprised. "She did."

"Her father speaks highly of her. Says she's got a good head on her shoulders, knows what she wants." He paused. "Reminds me of your mother that way. Knowing her own mind. Helping the people around her see things more clearly."

It was the closest to a blessing I was likely to get.

"Thanks, Dad."

He nodded once—the same nod he'd given at my booth, small and significant—and walked back toward the main fairgrounds where Beth and my brother were waiting.

I stood there alone in the warm afternoon, trying to process what had just happened.

My father had apologized. Had admitted to being wrong. Had expressed pride in me and interest in working together. Had mentioned my mother without shutting down. Had acknowledged Audrey's role in my growth.

We'd had an actual conversation. Not a lecture, not a fight. A real exchange between two adults who respected each other.

I'd been fighting for this moment my whole life. Fighting against my father's expectations, then fighting for his respect. And now that I had it—now that we'd found this new ground to stand on together—it felt different than I'd imagined.

It felt earned. Real. Sustainable.

Not the fantasy of perfect understanding where all our problems disappeared. But something better: mutual respect between two people who'd learned to see each other clearly.

I pulled out my phone and texted Audrey: "Where are you?"

Her response came immediately: "Cotton candy stand. Everything ok?"

"Yeah. Everything's good. Be there in a minute."

I took a breath, let it out slowly. Around me, the fair continued its familiar rhythms. But something fundamental had shifted. My father and I had found our way to each other—not by one of us changing to match the other, but by both of us choosing to meet in the middle.

That was worth more than any blue ribbon.

That was worth everything.

I headed back toward the fairgrounds, toward Audrey and Tommy and the rest of the evening. Toward the life I was choosing, the path I was building, the future I could finally see clearly.

My father's son. But also my own man.

Both. Not one or the other.

Finally, impossibly, both.
