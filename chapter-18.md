# Chapter 18: The Hard Question

I woke up to sunlight stabbing through my window and a headache that felt like divine punishment.

Pain shot through my knuckles when I tried to flex my hands. The whole night came flooding back—the drag strip, the liquor, the fight.

I sat up slowly, still in yesterday's clothes. My shirt was torn at the shoulder, spotted with dried blood. My knuckles were swollen and split. The clock said nine-thirty. I'd missed morning chores, and my father had let me.

In the bathroom, the guy in the mirror looked hungover, bruised, and stupid. I brushed my teeth twice but couldn't get the taste of regret out of my mouth.

I was in the kitchen making coffee when I heard the car.

Through the window, I saw Audrey's blue Ford pulling up the drive. My stomach dropped. I looked down at myself—still in torn, bloody clothes, knuckles purple and swollen. Evidence I couldn't hide or explain away.

She got out of her car wearing dungarees and a simple blouse, her hair pulled back. She looked clean and clear-eyed and nothing like me.

I met her on the porch before she could knock.

"Hey," I said.

She looked at my knuckles, my torn shirt, my face. Her expression didn't change—not disappointed, not angry. Just patient. Waiting.

"Diane called me last night," she said. "Told me you were at the strip. That there was a fight."

Of course Diane had called. Small towns didn't keep secrets.

"I'm fine," I said automatically.

"I didn't ask if you were fine. I asked—" She stopped, shook her head. "Can we talk?"

"Yeah. Let me just—" I gestured at my clothes.

"You don't need to change. We're just walking."

---

We headed out past the barn, into the cotton fields where the stalks stood shoulder-high and rustled in the morning breeze. The sun was already hot, promising another scorcher of a day. My head pounded with each step, but I welcomed the discomfort. Felt deserved.

Audrey didn't say anything for the first few minutes, just walked beside me with her hands in her pockets. I kept waiting for her to start, to ask what happened or tell me she was disappointed or say she'd expected better.

Instead, she asked, "Are you changing because you want to, or because you think it's what I want?"

I stopped walking. "What?"

"Last night. Was that you sliding back, or being honest about who you are? Because if you're only trying to be different for my sake, it's not going to last."

"I'm trying to be better."

"For who?"

"For myself." But I wasn't sure.

Audrey waited, her silence worse than any accusation.

"I don't know," I admitted. "Everyone's watching. Waiting for me to screw up. My father still dismisses everything I say. Ray won't shut up about how I'm faking it for you."

"So you proved him right?"

"It was easier. Going to the strip, racing, fighting—I know how to do that. Nobody's disappointed when I do it because they expected it all along."

"Easier isn't better."

"I know that. But trying to be different is exhausting. Every day I have to prove I'm not who everyone knows I am. And I'm not sure anymore who I'm supposed to be. The guy who fights? Or the guy who reads farming journals and wants his father's approval?"

"Maybe you're supposed to figure out which one is real," Audrey said quietly.

I looked away, across the fields to where the farmhouse sat square and solid against the sky. Three generations of Turners had stood right here, looked at this same view. They'd all known who they were. Why couldn't I?

"What if the real one is the one everyone already knows?" I asked. "The disappointment. The screwup."

"Is it?"

"I don't know!" The frustration burst out of me. "I want to be different. I want to care about the farm, to have a relationship with my father that isn't just disappointment, to be worth—" I stopped before I said *worth you*, but Audrey heard it anyway.

"That's what I'm asking," she said. "Are you trying to be different for yourself, or because you're trying to be worth me?"

The distinction felt impossible. How was I supposed to separate what I wanted from what I wanted her to see in me?

Audrey started walking again, and I followed. We moved between the rows of cotton, the plants brushing against us, leaving traces of white on our clothes.

"When I left Atlanta," she said after a while, "my mother told me I'd be back in six months. She said I'd realize I'd made a mistake—that I couldn't just walk away from the life she'd planned for me, that I'd miss the city and my friends and being part of her world."

I hadn't heard this before. I listened.

"The first few months here were hard," Audrey continued. "Really hard. I questioned myself constantly. Was I being brave or just running away? Was I making a real choice or just rebelling? Every time I missed Atlanta, I wondered if my mother was right—if I'd come back having proved I couldn't handle a different kind of life."

"But you didn't go back."

"No." She picked a cotton boll, turning it over in her hands. "Because I finally figured out that I wasn't staying in Oakdale for my mother. I wasn't staying to prove her wrong or to punish her for trying to control my life. I was staying because *I* chose it. Because this is what *I* wanted, regardless of what anyone else thought about it."

She stopped and looked at me.

"That's the difference, Wade. I'm not here because someone else decided I should be. I'm here because I decided. And when I leave—for college or whatever comes next—that'll be my decision too. Not my mother's. Not my father's. Mine."

The morning sun caught in her hair, turned the edges gold. She looked completely certain, completely at peace with herself. I'd never felt that way in my life.

"How did you know?" I asked. "That you were doing it for yourself?"

"I asked myself a hard question." She held my gaze. "If everything else disappeared—if my mother stopped disapproving, if I had no one to prove wrong, if there was no one watching at all—would I still choose this?"

Would I?

If my father stopped caring what I did, if the town stopped watching, if Audrey wasn't in the picture—would I still want to change? Would I still read those agricultural journals? Would I still want to find a way to honor the farm while doing it on my own terms?

Last night had felt good for about five minutes. Then empty. This morning it just felt like failure.

But working on that irrigation pump weeks ago—that had felt good and stayed good. Talking to Mr. Palmer about sustainable farming, realizing I had ideas worth discussing—that had felt like discovering a part of myself I didn't know existed.

"If you weren't here," I said slowly, "I'd still want to figure out how to do this. The farm, I mean. On my own terms. I'd still want my father to see me—really see me—instead of just seeing his disappointment reflected back."

"Then that's real," Audrey said. "That's you changing for yourself."

"But last night—"

"Last night you had a bad week and made bad choices. That happens. Change isn't linear, Wade. You don't just decide to be different and then smoothly become a new person. You backslide. You mess up. But messing up once doesn't erase everything you've been working toward unless you let it."

I looked down at my knuckles. "Everyone's going to say they knew it wouldn't last."

"Let them."

"That's easy for you to say."

"No," Audrey said, and for the first time there was an edge to her voice. "It's not easy. It's never easy. Do you think it was easy when my mother told everyone in Atlanta that I'd be crawling back within months? When her friends looked at me with pity, like I was making a huge mistake? It wasn't easy. But I did it anyway because I was doing it for me."

She stepped closer.

"You can't control what people think or say, Wade. You can only control what you do and why you do it. If you're trying to be different because you actually want a different life, then keep trying. But if you're doing it because you think it's what I want, or because you want to prove Ray wrong, or because you want your father's approval—that's not going to sustain you. External motivation only works until it doesn't."

The truth of it settled in my bones. All this time, I'd been tangled up in everyone else's opinions—my father's disappointment, the town's judgment, Ray's provocations, Audrey's faith in me. I'd been trying to be whoever they needed me to be instead of figuring out who I wanted to be.

"I don't know if I'm strong enough," I admitted. "To keep trying when everyone's waiting for me to fail."

Audrey's expression softened. "Then you find out. But you find out for yourself, not for me. I care about you, Wade. But I can't want your change more than you want it. Nobody can."

We stood there in the cotton field, the sun climbing higher, the day heating up around us. My head still hurt. My knuckles still throbbed. But something had shifted—some weight I didn't know I'd been carrying.

"I'm sorry," I said. "About last night."

"Don't apologize to me. This isn't about me."

She was right. It wasn't.

It was about whether I had the courage to want something for myself and keep wanting it even when it got hard. Even when I messed up. Even when nobody believed in me.

Even when I didn't believe in myself.

"I should go," Audrey said. "Let you think."

She started to walk back toward her car, and I watched her go—steady, certain, choosing her own path. Everything I wanted to be and wasn't sure I could be.

"Audrey," I called.

She turned.

"Thank you. For asking the hard question."

She smiled, but it was sad around the edges. "You have to answer it, though. I can't do that part for you."

I knew. God, I knew.

After she drove away, I stood alone in the cotton field for a long time, asking myself the question she'd posed.

If no one was watching, if I had nothing to prove and no one to impress—what did I actually want?

The answer was there, waiting. I just had to be brave enough to claim it.
