# Chapter 26: What She Helped Him See

I found Audrey exactly where she said she'd be, standing by the cotton candy stand watching little kids run past with sticky hands and summer joy.

She turned when I approached, and whatever she saw on my face made her smile.

"Good talk?"

"Yeah." I couldn't quite get more words out yet. The emotion from the conversation with my father was still too close to the surface.

She waited, patient as always. Not pushing, just present.

"He apologized," I said finally. "My father. Said he was wrong about me, about what I was doing. That he wants to work together to implement some of the proposals. As partners."

Audrey's smile widened. "Wade, that's wonderful."

"I know. It's—" I shook my head, still processing. "It's what I've wanted for so long I forgot I was allowed to actually have it."

"You earned it."

"We both know I wouldn't have gotten here without you."

"Wade—"

"No, I mean it." I needed her to hear this, to understand what she'd given me. "None of this would have happened if you hadn't pushed me. Asked the hard questions. Made me examine why I was doing what I was doing."

She started to protest again, but I kept going.

"You refused to let me hide behind my own rebellion. Every time I tried to blame my father or the town or my circumstances, you made me look at my own choices. My own patterns. You held up a mirror until I couldn't avoid seeing myself clearly."

"That's what people who care about each other do," Audrey said.

"I know. But not everyone does it well. Not everyone has the courage to ask the uncomfortable questions instead of just telling you what you want to hear." I took her hand. "You helped me see the difference between running from something and moving toward something. Between fighting against and fighting for. Between changing for external validation and changing because I actually wanted to be different."

"Those were your realizations, not mine. I just asked questions."

"The right questions. At the right times. That made all the difference."

We started walking, threading through the fair crowds, past the carnival rides and game booths and families enjoying the evening. The sun was setting, painting everything in golden light. The Ferris wheel turned against a pink-orange sky.

"When I showed up in Oakdale," Audrey said after a while, "you were the first person I met who didn't seem to care about fitting in. Everyone else was so concerned with doing things the right way, saying the right things, being who they were supposed to be. But you were just—yourself. Angry and rebellious and completely genuine."

"You thought my anger was attractive?"

"I thought your authenticity was. Even if that authenticity was being angry." She squeezed my hand. "Most people wear masks. You didn't. You just felt everything loudly and let everyone know it."

"That's a generous interpretation of me being a screwup."

"You weren't a screwup. You were lost. There's a difference." She looked up at me. "And I knew—from the first real conversation we had—that you weren't actually angry at farming or your father or Oakdale. You were angry at feeling trapped. At not knowing how to honor where you came from while still choosing where you were going."

She'd seen that from the beginning. Before I'd understood it myself.

"I didn't do anything special," Audrey continued. "I just saw you clearly and asked you to see yourself the same way. That's not saving you or fixing you. That's just—caring about you enough to be honest."

"It was still everything," I said quietly.

We reached the edge of the fairgrounds, where the crowds thinned out and you could see the parking lot and beyond it the fields stretching into evening. Audrey led me to a quieter spot, away from the noise and activity.

"I need to tell you something," she said.

My stomach dropped. "Okay."

"Next year—when I go to college—I'll probably end up out of state. Georgia Tech has a good engineering program, but MIT and Carnegie Mellon are better. I've been looking at applications."

"I figured," I said, even though the words sat heavy in my chest.

"And I don't know what that means for us. For this." She gestured between us. "But I need you to know it's not about you. It's not about this not being enough. It's about me choosing my path, the same way you're choosing yours."

"I know."

"Do you? Because at the start of summer, you thought I'd leave and it would mean you'd failed somehow. That you weren't worth staying for."

She was right. I had thought that.

"But now?" Audrey asked.

"Now I think—" I sorted through the tangle of feelings. "Now I think you need to choose what's right for you. And I need to choose what's right for me. And if those paths run parallel for a while, that's great. If they don't, that doesn't make either choice wrong."

"Exactly."

"But it still scares me," I admitted. "Losing you."

"You're not losing me. I'm just—choosing. Same as you." She touched my face gently. "We'll figure it out. People who care about each other figure it out."

"How?"

"I don't know yet. But I know I'm not going anywhere for another year. I know we can talk on the phone and write letters and visit when we're both home. I know long distance is hard but not impossible." Her thumb traced my cheekbone. "And I know that what we have is real enough to be worth the effort."

The tightness in my chest eased slightly. "You think so?"

"I know so."

We stood there as the evening deepened around us, the fair lights starting to glow brighter against the darkening sky. Somewhere a band was playing, and kids were screaming on the Tilt-A-Whirl, and families were gathering for the evening livestock shows.

Normal summer fair sounds. But everything felt different. Bigger. More significant.

"I love you," I said.

The words came out easier than I expected. Not the reckless declaration of someone desperate for validation, but the simple truth of someone who knew himself well enough to know what he felt.

Audrey's expression softened. "I know."

"I needed to say it. Directly. Not just show it through changing or trying or working on myself. Actually say the words."

"Wade Turner being emotionally articulate. Look at that growth."

"I'm working on it." I pulled her closer. "I love you. Not the desperate love that needs you to save me or fix me or make me whole. But the kind that—that makes me want to be clearer. More honest. More myself."

"That's the best kind," Audrey said.

"You make me better. Not by trying to change me, but by helping me see who I already am underneath all the noise and rebellion and fear."

"You did that yourself."

"You helped."

"Okay. I helped." She smiled. "And you helped me too, you know."

"How?"

"You reminded me that choosing my own path doesn't mean doing it alone. That I can be independent and still let people in. That asking for what I need isn't weakness." She leaned against me. "You showed me what it looks like when someone genuinely works to grow. Not just talks about it, but does the hard work of examining their own patterns and making real changes."

"I had good motivation."

"You had good reasons. There's a difference."

We kissed then—slow and sweet and sure. Different from the desperate kisses earlier in the summer when everything was uncertain and I was still trying to prove something. This kiss was grounded. Committed. The kiss of two people who knew themselves and chose each other anyway.

When we pulled apart, Audrey said, "I love you too. In case that wasn't clear."

"It was clear. But I like hearing it anyway."

"The version of you that was always there under the armor. The one who cares deeply and thinks seriously and wants to build something meaningful. That's who I love."

"He's still figuring things out."

"Good. So am I. We can figure things out together."

"Even when you're at MIT and I'm here?"

"Even then. If we choose to." She looked up at me seriously. "Because that's what this is, Wade. A choice. Not fate or necessity or completing each other. Just—choosing. Every day. To be honest and supportive and present with each other."

"I choose that," I said. "I choose you. For as long as you'll have me."

"Then I guess we're doing this."

"I guess we are."

We walked back toward the main fairgrounds hand in hand. The evening was in full swing now—the livestock judging drawing crowds, the carnival rides lit up bright, the smell of fried food and sugar heavy in the air.

Tommy found us by the ring toss, where he was attempting to win a stuffed animal and failing spectacularly.

"There you are! They're about to start the pie judging. Your sister-in-law entered three pies and she's convinced she's going to sweep the category."

"Beth's pies are good," I said.

"They're amazing. Come on, we have to watch and be supportive family members."

The three of us headed toward the exhibition tent, Audrey on one side, Tommy on the other. My best friend and the girl I loved, both choosing to be here with me. Both believing I was worth their time and attention and care.

Six months ago, I'd been fighting everyone and everything, convinced I was alone because that's what I deserved. Now I was surrounded by people who saw me clearly and chose to be in my life anyway.

Not because I'd become perfect. Not because I'd fixed all my problems or stopped making mistakes.

But because I was doing the work. Making real choices. Growing into someone I could be proud of.

And that was enough.

More than enough.

It was everything.
