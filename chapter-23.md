# Chapter 23: The Agriculture Fair

The county fairgrounds looked the same as they had every August for as long as I could remember.

White tents stretched across the main field, livestock pens lined up behind the exhibition barn, the smell of funnel cakes and diesel fuel mixing in the humid air. The Ferris wheel turned lazy circles against a blue sky. Kids ran past with cotton candy. Farmers congregated in clusters, discussing crops and weather and the price of feed.

I'd been coming here since I was five years old. But I'd never been nervous about it before.

I pulled my truck into the exhibitor lot Friday morning, my stomach tight with a feeling that wasn't quite fear but wasn't quite excitement either. Something in between. Something new.

My presentation boards were carefully loaded in the truck bed, along with the bound proposals I'd printed at the library and the display materials I'd spent hours preparing. Everything organized, everything ready.

Everything riding on this.

No. Not riding on it. That was the old thinking—the external validation thinking. This mattered to me regardless of what happened. But still. I wanted it to go well.

"You need help?"

I turned to find Mr. Palmer walking across the lot, already sweating in the morning heat.

"Yeah. Thanks."

We unloaded together, carrying everything to the agriculture innovation section in the far tent. The Turner family had always had a presence at the fair—my father and brother entered produce and livestock every year, served on judging committees, represented three generations of farming excellence. This year, for the first time, I had my own booth.

My own work to show.

The setup took an hour. Display boards showing crop rotation diagrams and water conservation data. Bound proposals arranged neatly on the table. A simple sign: "Sustainable Farming Practices for Small Family Farms - Wade Turner." Information sheets for anyone who wanted to take materials home.

It looked professional. Real. Like something that mattered.

"You ready for this?" Mr. Palmer asked as I adjusted the last display board.

"I think so."

"You've done good work, Wade. Remember that, whatever happens."

I nodded, throat tight.

The fair officially opened at ten. By ten-thirty, people started filtering through the agriculture tent.

Most walked past with barely a glance—they were here for the livestock competitions or the pie-judging or the carnival rides. But some stopped. Read the displays. Picked up the information sheets.

An older farmer I didn't know studied my crop rotation diagram for a long minute.

"This based on actual data or just theory?" he asked finally.

"Both," I said. "The rotation cycle is adapted from research out of the state agricultural extension, but I've tailored it specifically for Georgia cotton and tobacco farms with 200-400 acre operations. The soil restoration timeline accounts for our specific climate and growing season."

He grunted, moved to the next board. "Water conservation numbers look optimistic."

"They're based on pivot irrigation systems versus traditional flood irrigation. I can show you the breakdown—"

I walked him through the calculations, answered his questions about initial investment costs and maintenance requirements. He asked pointed, practical questions—the kind that came from someone who'd been farming for decades and knew exactly where theory fell apart against reality.

When he finally left, he took one of my bound proposals with him.

My hands were shaking.

More people came through as the morning wore on. Some dismissive, some curious, some genuinely interested. I answered questions until my voice went hoarse. Explained concepts over and over. Defended my data, acknowledged limitations, pointed people to additional resources.

Mr. Palmer brought colleagues from his agricultural equipment company—professionals who worked with farms across three states. They asked technical questions I'd prepared for, challenged assumptions I'd anticipated. By the end of their visit, they were discussing how his company might be able to support implementation of similar programs on other family farms.

"We'd like to stay in touch," one of them said, handing me a business card. "This kind of innovation-tradition integration is exactly what the industry needs."

I tucked the card carefully into my pocket, trying not to show how much those words meant.

Around noon, Diane appeared with a lemonade and a smile.

"Look at you," she said, surveying my booth with obvious pride. "All professional and everything."

"Thanks for coming."

"Wouldn't miss it. Half the diner's been talking about Wade Turner's big agriculture project." She lowered her voice. "Between you and me, I think more people are rooting for you than you realize."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. People remember you before—" She paused, chose her words carefully. "Before things got hard. They want to see you do well."

After she left, I stood there for a minute, letting that sink in. The town hadn't written me off completely. Some of them, at least, were willing to give me a chance.

Ray Coleman showed up around two o'clock.

I saw him coming before he reached my booth—hard to miss, surrounded by three of his buddies, all of them wearing matching sneers. They made a show of stopping at my display, looking at everything with exaggerated interest.

"Well, well," Ray said loudly. "Wade Turner's little school project. Isn't this precious?"

I kept my expression neutral. "Ray."

"'Sustainable Farming Practices,'" he read off my sign in a mocking tone. "That's real cute. How long did it take you to put this together? Week? Two weeks?"

"Six weeks," I said calmly.

"Six weeks of playing farmer." He picked up one of my bound proposals, flipped through it dismissively. "Must be nice, having all that time to make pretty charts while the rest of us do actual work."

His friends laughed right on cue.

Every instinct in my body screamed to defend myself. To point out that I'd done all my regular farm work plus the research and writing. To tell Ray exactly where he could shove his opinions. To make him eat those words the hard way.

But I didn't.

"Thanks for stopping by," I said instead. "Information sheets are free if you want one."

Ray's expression flickered—he'd expected a fight, wanted a fight. My calm response threw him.

"This is all for show anyway," he said, rallying. "For that city girl, probably. Does she know you're just playing dress-up? That in a month you'll be back to your old ways?"

"If you're done, I've got other people waiting to ask actual questions."

It wasn't quite true—there was a lull in visitors—but it didn't matter. I was done engaging. Ray could mock me all he wanted. His opinion didn't change the quality of my work or the value of what I'd built.

He lingered for another minute, trying to provoke me, but I just stood there. Calm. Centered. Uninterested in his drama.

Finally, he walked away, muttering something to his friends about how I'd gotten soft.

Maybe I had. Or maybe I'd just gotten smarter about what was worth fighting for.

Three-thirty, and the tent was crowded with the afternoon surge of fairgoers. I was explaining water conservation benefits to a young couple interested in starting their own farm when I saw him.

My father.

He walked into the tent with a group of other established farmers—men his age, men he'd known for decades. They were making the rounds, examining all the agriculture innovation entries, discussing them in low voices.

My mouth went dry.

I finished answering the couple's questions, barely tracking what I was saying. My attention was locked on Marcus, watching him move from booth to booth, watching him get closer.

He stopped at my booth.

The other farmers kept moving, but my father stayed. He stood there in his work clothes—jeans and a flannel shirt despite the heat, boots dusty from the fields—and looked at my displays.

I held my breath.

He read the information on my boards. Studied the crop rotation diagram. Examined the water conservation data. Picked up one of the bound proposals and flipped through it—not the quick dismissive flip from the barn, but slow, careful pages.

I wanted to say something. Wanted to explain, defend, justify. But I stayed quiet. Let the work speak for itself.

Time stretched out painfully long. Other visitors came and went. Marcus kept reading.

Finally, he set the proposal down. Looked at me for the first time since arriving.

Our eyes met.

He nodded. Once. Small. Almost imperceptible.

Then he turned and walked away to catch up with the other farmers.

That was it. No words. No praise. Just a nod.

But standing there in that crowded tent, surrounded by the work I'd done and the path I'd chosen, that single nod felt like everything.

It wasn't approval—not exactly. It was acknowledgment. Recognition. Respect, maybe, or at least the beginning of it.

My father had seen my work. Really seen it. Had taken the time to examine it carefully, to consider it seriously. Had given me that small nod that said more than words could.

I exhaled slowly, releasing tension I hadn't known I was holding.

A middle-aged woman approached my booth with questions about cover crops, and I turned my attention to her. Answered her inquiries. Explained the benefits. Handed her an information sheet.

The afternoon continued. More visitors, more questions, more conversations about farming practices and soil health and water conservation.

And through it all, I kept thinking about that nod.

Small. Significant. Enough.

I'd shown up. Done the work. Put myself out there.

And my father had seen it.

Whatever happened next—whether I won the competition, whether he ever fully understood what I was trying to do, whether we ever bridged the gap completely—I'd done this part.

I'd chosen forward. Fought for something that mattered. Believed in myself enough to try.

The rest would come. Or it wouldn't. But I'd be okay either way.

Because this—standing in this tent, sharing work I believed in, feeling the satisfaction of having tried—this was already enough.

This was already everything.
