# Chapter 22: Choosing Forward

The next morning, I was back in the barn before sunrise.

My father's truck was already gone, which gave me space to work. I spread the proposal out on the workbench again, looking at it with fresh eyes.

It was good work. My father's dismissal didn't change that.

Over the next week, I refined everything. Added detailed implementation timelines, broke the project into testable phases. Created cost-benefit analyses that accounted for variables my father would worry about—initial investment costs, crop yield during transition, labor requirements. I anticipated every objection and addressed them.

Mr. Palmer stopped by Tuesday evening, ostensibly to discuss fall equipment orders with my father. But afterward, he found me in the barn.

"Heard your father wasn't receptive," he said, settling onto the crate across from my workbench.

"That's putting it mildly."

"Can I see what you've been working on?"

I handed him the revised proposal. He read through it slowly, making occasional marks with a pencil, asking clarifying questions. Unlike my father, he actually engaged with the content—challenged assumptions, pointed out places where my reasoning could be stronger, suggested ways to present the data more effectively.

"This is really solid, Wade," he said finally. "Genuinely impressive work. The integration of traditional practices with modern sustainability measures is exactly where agricultural innovation needs to go."

The validation felt good, but I tried not to lean on it too hard. External validation couldn't be my foundation. I was doing this for myself.

Still. It helped.

"The presentation matters as much as the content," Mr. Palmer continued. "You could have the best ideas in the world, but if you can't communicate them clearly, they won't go anywhere. Want help polishing the pitch?"

I did.

We spent two hours working through how to present the proposal effectively. How to lead with the problem before introducing solutions. How to use the data to support claims without overwhelming the audience. How to anticipate questions and address concerns proactively.

"You're good at this," Mr. Palmer said as we wrapped up. "The synthesis of technical knowledge and practical application. Have you thought about studying agricultural science? There are good programs at the state university."

I hadn't. Or I had, but only in the vague way you think about impossible things. College felt like something for people who had their lives figured out, who came from families that expected it.

But maybe it wasn't impossible. Maybe it was just another choice I could make.

"I'll think about it," I said.

Wednesday evening, Audrey came over. We sat on the tailgate of my truck at the overlook, and I walked her through the proposal, practicing my presentation.

She asked good questions—not technical ones, but clarifying ones. "What do you mean by soil health? Can you explain that more simply? What's the biggest risk with this approach?"

"You're making me think," I said after the third time she'd pushed me to explain something more clearly.

"That's the point. If you can explain it to me—someone who's interested but not an expert—you can explain it to anyone."

We went through it twice more. By the end, I could present the key points without looking at my notes, could answer questions without hesitation, could explain complex ideas in language anyone could understand.

"You're ready," Audrey said.

"You think?"

"I know." She nudged my shoulder. "You sound like someone who knows what they're talking about. Like someone who believes in what they're doing."

"I do believe in it."

"I can tell. That's what makes the difference."

We sat in comfortable silence for a while, looking out at the valley. The sun was setting, painting everything in shades of orange and gold. From up here, the Turner farm looked peaceful. Permanent. Like it had been here forever and would be here forever more.

"I've been thinking," I said. "About what you said before. About figuring out what I want and pursuing it regardless of whether people believe in me."

"Yeah?"

"I think I want to study agricultural science. After high school. Learn more about this stuff—sustainable farming, crop management, soil conservation. All of it." Saying it out loud made it feel more real. More possible. "Maybe I could come back and help modernize not just our farm but others in the area. Help family farms adapt without losing what makes them special."

Audrey smiled. "That sounds like a good plan."

"It would mean staying in Oakdale. Or coming back to it anyway."

"Is that what you want?"

I thought about it. A few months ago, all I'd wanted was to leave. To get as far from this town and this farm and these expectations as possible. But somewhere along the way, that had shifted.

"Yeah," I said. "I think it is. Not because I'm stuck here or because it's what's expected. But because this is where the work I want to do is. This is where I could make a difference."

"Then that's what you should do."

"What about you?" I asked. "You still planning on leaving for college?"

"Eventually, yeah. I want to study engineering. Probably not in Georgia." She looked at me carefully. "That doesn't bother you?"

"It did at first. I thought—" I stopped, trying to find the right words. "I thought if you left, it would mean I wasn't enough. That I'd failed somehow. But that's not how it works, is it?"

"No. It's not."

"You need to choose your path. I need to choose mine. And if they line up for a while, that's great. If they don't—well, we figure it out."

Audrey leaned her head on my shoulder. "Look at you, being all mature."

"I have a good teacher."

"You're doing the work yourself, Wade. I'm just asking questions."

Maybe. But the questions mattered. They'd forced me to examine things I'd been avoiding, to make real choices instead of just reacting. That was worth more than I could say.

Thursday night at dinner, my father broke the silence.

"I read through your proposal again," he said.

I froze, fork halfway to my mouth.

"The full thing," Marcus continued. "Not just skimming it like before. Actually read it."

I set my fork down carefully. "Yeah?"

"Some of those ideas—" He paused, seemed to be choosing his words carefully. "They're not all bad."

Not all bad. From my father, that was practically effusive praise.

"The crop rotation cycle you laid out," he said. "That's actually smart. And the water conservation numbers—if they're accurate—that could make a real difference, especially with how the drought's been going."

I couldn't breathe. He was actually engaging with it. Actually considering it.

"Some of it's impractical for our scale," Marcus went on. "And some of your cost estimates don't account for things breaking down or seasons going wrong. But the core ideas—" Another pause. "They have merit."

"Really?"

"Don't sound so shocked. I'm not completely closed-minded." He took a drink of water. "I just need to know you're serious. That this isn't another phase that'll blow over in a month."

"It's not a phase."

"We'll see."

It wasn't approval. Not quite. But it wasn't dismissal either. It was—conversation. Actual conversation, the kind where both people were listening instead of just waiting for their turn to talk.

"The fair's this weekend," I said carefully. "I'm entering the agriculture innovation category."

"I know."

"Are you—" I stopped, not sure how to ask.

"Am I going to be there?" Marcus finished. "I go every year. This year won't be any different."

Which wasn't quite saying he'd come to see my presentation specifically, but it also wasn't saying he wouldn't.

"If these ideas work," I said, "if the judges think they have merit—would you consider implementing some of them? On the farm?"

Marcus was quiet for a long moment. I held my breath.

"If you prove they work at the fair," he said finally, "and if you're willing to put in the actual work of implementing them—not just the planning, but the doing—then maybe we can talk about it."

Maybe we can talk about it.

Not yes. But not no either. Conditional. Qualified. But something.

"I'm willing," I said. "To do the work. All of it."

"Then I guess we'll see."

After dinner, I helped clear the table—another thing I'd started doing without being asked. My father washed while I dried, the two of us working in silence that felt less hostile than it used to. Almost comfortable.

"Wade," he said as I was putting away the last plate.

"Yeah?"

"That proposal. It's good work. Real work." He kept his eyes on the sink, on the soap and water. "I may not always show it right, but I do notice when you're trying."

My throat tightened. "Thanks."

He nodded once, and that was it. But it was enough.

That night in the barn, organizing my materials for the fair, I felt something I hadn't felt in years: hope.

Not desperate hope that everything would magically work out. But quiet, steady hope from doing good work and trusting the process.

My father had read my proposal. Really read it. Had found merit in it. Had opened the door—just a crack—to the possibility of working together.

It was more than I'd had a week ago. More than I'd had a month ago.

It was a start.

I thought about what Tommy had said at the pond: that I was really doing this. For myself. Not for anyone else.

He was right.

This project, this path I was choosing—it wasn't about proving my father wrong or making Audrey proud or showing the town I'd changed. Those things might happen as side effects, and that would be great.

But the foundation was simpler than that.

I believed in this work. I believed it mattered. I believed I could do it.

And for the first time in my life, I believed in myself.

That belief felt like solid ground under my feet. Something I could build on. Something that wouldn't shift every time someone doubted me or dismissed me or told me I wasn't good enough.

Because I knew better now. I'd done the work. Put in the hours. Made the choice to try and kept choosing it even when it got hard.

That was mine. Nobody could take that away.

The county fair was two days away. I was ready.

Not because I knew I'd win. Not because I knew my father would suddenly understand everything. Not because I knew how any of it would turn out.

But because I'd done the work for the right reasons. Because I'd chosen forward instead of running away. Because I'd fought for something instead of just fighting against everything.

That was enough.

That was more than enough.

It was everything.
